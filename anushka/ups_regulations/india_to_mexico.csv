NAFTA Certificate of Origin
(Not applicable for U.S. to Puerto Rico or Puerto Rico to U.S.)
NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) was established to allow preferential duty treatment for goods manufactured and shipped between the Customs territories of Canada, Mexico, and the United States (including Puerto Rico). The following information applies to commodities manufactured within the NAFTA region only.
For all commercial shipments over 1,000 USD, a completed NAFTA Certificate of Origin, supplied by the shipper, is required in order to qualify for a possible lower rate or elimination of duty.
In order for commercial shipments 1,000 USD or less to qualify for a possible lower rate or elimination of duty, the shipper must provide either:
A completed NAFTA Certificate of Origin, or
The NAFTA Statement on the commercial invoice.
The shipper also needs to print their name, title and date with a signature on the invoice.
Shipments importing to the U.S. for the sole purpose of personal use do not need the NAFTA Certificate of Origin or the NAFTA Statement ""I hereby certify that the goods covered by this shipment qualifies as an originating good for purposes of preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA."" to qualify for NAFTA tariffs. If the goods are made in a NAFTA country or territory and the invoice states ""personal use"" the shipment will be processed under the NAFTA tariff codes. NAFTA does not exempt goods from Value Added Tax (in Mexico, IVA).
Certificates of Origin may be used for multiple importations of the same goods made in a period not exceeding one year from the issuance date of the Certificate. For more information, please see the following website:

ANAM
On January 1, 2022, the National Customs Agency of Mexico (ANAM) came into operation as a decentralized administrative body of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) replacing the General Customs Administration (AGA); which supposes a temporarily and indefinite transition period for their internal activities.
The National Customs Agency of Mexico will be endowed with technical, operational, administrative and management autonomy, it will have the character of a tax and Customs authority, in addition to having the power to issue resolutions within the scope of its competence. The creation of the Agency is given with the objective of continuing the strategy of the current administration in the fight against smuggling, the introduction of drugs and corruption.

The Mexican government will use this to verify the operations carried out by the participants in the transfer of merchandise. It´s the full obligation of the Carrier company to generate it properly.
In order to generate this document automatically, UPS will rely on technological tools that allow us to extract information directly from air waybills generated by customers; therefore, as of January 1, 2022, UPS Manual Waybills will no longer be available.
Given this change, in order to make shipments in the shortest possible time and without errors, customers must be kept informed, analyze their shipping history, upload documentation, etc. Our strategy is focused on helping your company to go digital through the use of tools such as Worldship or CampuShip. We recommend you take your precautions to avoid setbacks.
