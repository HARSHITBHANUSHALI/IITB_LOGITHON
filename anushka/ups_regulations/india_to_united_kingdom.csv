Import Documentation,"Import License
Customs may require an import license for certain products from certain countries or territories, depending on the harmonized tariff code.
The importer must obtain the import license from the Department for Business Innovation and Skills.
An original export license from the exporter of the country or territory of origin might be necessary to obtain the import license. The requirement of an import license is dependent on the country or territory of origin of the goods, not the country or territory of export.
For further detailed information it is highly recommended to contact your chamber of commerce.
Product Safety
Market Surveillance
Market Surveillance is organized and performed at national level. Each EU (European Union) member state is responsible for surveillance activities on its territory. Customs authorities are usually part of the market surveillance activities.
On customs request the ""Declaration of Conformity"" has to be provided by the shipper, the manufacturer or his assigned representative in the EU or the importer.
Declaration of Conformity
The Declaration of Conformity (DoC) is a document in which the manufacturer, or his authorized representative within the EU indicates that the product meets all the necessary requirements of the directives applicable for the specific product. The DoC shall contain the name and the address of the manufacturer along with information about the product (for example, brand and serial number). The DoC must be signed by an individual working for the manufacturer or his authorized representative.
On request, the manufacturer or his authorized representative within the EU must provide the DoC. In case the manufacturer is not an EU entity and has no authorized representative, the importer must be able to provide a copy of the DoC and additional proofs if requested.
Free Trade Agreements
Bilateral free trade agreements or unilateral autonomous preferential agreements allow the import clearance of certain products with a reduced duty rate or with a full duty exemption. The products benefiting from the preferential treatment must fulfil the necessary rules of originating in a country or territory covered by the preferential trade agreement.
An exporter who wants his products to benefit from the preferential treatment must be able to proof that his products fulfil the rules to be originating in a country or territory covered by the preferential trade agreement and they must provide a preferential document validated by the customs authorities or document with a valid preferential statement issued by themselves.
The preferential trade agreement foresees the following preferential proofs above.
Import Control System 2 (ICS2)
On March 1, 2023, the European Union launched Release 2 of their Import Control System 2 (ICS2) for goods transported by air to EU (European Union) destinations plus Norway, Northern Ireland and Switzerland (regardless of origin).
What is ICS2?
The Import Control System 2 (ICS2) is the second phase of electronic customs import system for the EU. This upgraded IT system is created to collect data about all goods entering the EU prior to their arrival. ICS2 aims to better protect Europes single market and its citizens with new customs safety and security measures and will facilitate free flow of trade through improved data-driven customs security processes that are adapted to global business models.
ICS2 is required for all shipments transiting via any EU country even if final destination is not a part of the EU, i.e. a shipment from Asia to the UK, where the goods are transiting via any EU country.
Importers are required to provide a six-digit Harmonized System (HS) code for each commodity line listed in the commercial invoice and/or detailed goods descriptions for the shipments to avoid potential delays, fines or penalties and facilitate customs clearance. Where more than one HS code is present, the net weight of each is also required. The Economic Operators Registration and Identification Number (EORI) for the shipment recipient / consignee is also mandatory.
When tendering a shipment to UPS Supply Chain Solutions destined to or via the EU, the following information is mandatory:
Shipper name, Shipper address, Recipient name, Recipient address, Number of packages, Gross weight, Acceptable goods description (see the full EU guidelines), Six-digit Harmonized System (HS) codes along with net weight of each where there is more than a single HS code involved. For EU-27, the recipients EORI number (see the full EU guidelines).
In a case where customers provide insufficient data to complete ICS2 data reporting requirements, UPS SCS will make a commercially reasonable effort to contact customers. If a shipper does not respond, the shipment would be held at the origin until all requirements are received.
Letters, correspondence and other document shipments of no commercial value are excluded from this requirement. For more information on HS Codes, check out our Importers Guide to HTS Codes.
For more information on ICS2, please visit the European Commission website.
Certificate of Origin
A certificate of origin is not required for the import clearance of textiles.
The country or territory of origin must be stated on the invoice for each invoice line. If the customs authorities doubt the correctness of the declared country or territory of origin they may request an additional proof which might be a certificate of origin.
Some commodities may require only an origin statement worded as follows; ""The exporter/supplier of the products covered by this invoice/document hereby declares that, except where otherwise indicated, these products are of __________ origin within the meaning of the rules in force in the European Community. Done at __________, on __________"". This must be followed by the name and address of the exporter or supplier and handwritten signature of the person authorized. Please contact your Chamber of Commerce to confirm whether a full Certificate of Origin is required. Photocopies of the Certificate of Origin are not accepted.
Form A
A Form A is only valid for imports from countries or territories covered by the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The products must fulfill the rules of be originating in the export country or territory Most products can be imported at a lower duty rate while others are fully exempted from duty. The Form A certificate shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country or territory on application having been made by the exporter. The exporter must be able to proof at any time the originating status of his products concerned. This form is valid for products of any value and must accompany the shipment in original.

Non-Food (not intended for human consumption) includes animal by-products, animal feed, samples for testing or research purposes (food-grade or non-food grade), and in vitro diagnostics (IVD).
Animal products and animal by-products are often subject to a veterinary inspection. These products can only be accepted under a special contract for International Special Commodities (ISC). In addition those products must undergo veterinary checks at an approved Veterinary Border Inspection Post (BIP) when entering the EU & EFTA countries or territories (EU regulations are aligned for EU countries or territories and NO; IS; CH; LI).
For UPS shipments arriving in the EU by air, Cologne is the first point of arrival /BIP. Inspections will be processed at Cologne but final customs clearance process will be issued in the destination country or territory.
Additional charges for Vet-inspection will be applicable  see Brokerage Services and Charges.

Test Reagent
Most of modern test reagents for diagnostic research are built on antibodies which are generated from animal tissue. There are two types of antibodies, the monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies.
Monoclonal antibodies are generated in vitro. Tissue from animals are taken (e.g. blood) and infected with certain substances or pathogens. The blood cells react with the production of antibodies which are than harvested and used for the production of the test kits. Due to the in vitro production and the controlled way of production those types of test kits are not subject to veterinarian control if it is a commercial production.
Polyclonal antibodies are gained from living animals like rabbits. They are infected with the substances / pathogens and the animals are producing antibodies. The antibodies are harvested from the blood stream of the animals. Test reagents with polyclonal antibodies are subject to vet inspections.

In order to ensure the implementation of the prohibition, the same Article establishes an obligation for the importer in the United Kingdom to provide evidence of the country of origin of the iron and steel inputs used in a third country for the processing of the iron and steel products imported into the United Kingdom.
The following documents may be considered as sufficient evidence of the country of origin of the iron or steel used as inputs.
The mill test certificate (MTCT) or through other means such as:-a statement or declaration by the exporter or manufacturer confirming that, after exercising due diligence, the imported product does not contain any Russian steel or iron-other documents may be invoices, delivery notes, suppliers declarations, including suppliers declarations covering several consignments (long term suppliers declarations), business correspondence, production descriptions, quality certificates and clauses in implemented purchase orders or contracts, provided that they include information of the origin of goods, etc. The type of document(s) may also vary depending on the nature of the product, in particular for finished products (e.g. sewing needles, tubes, etc.).
The customs authorities may, in the event of reasonable doubt, require additional evidence.
It is strongly recommended commercial invoices indicate-No Russian iron and steel products were used in the production of the specified goods/parts in accordance with Regulation2023 Regulations, Part 5 , Chapter 4CA, Regulation 46IA and 46IB egislation.gov.uk/uksi/2023/440/regulation UK HTS Chapter 72 and 73

Special Clearance Requirements,"Temporary Import
Within the customs procedure of temporary importation, goods designated to be imported for a limited stretch of time and remaining in the same state can be cleared without duty and VAT. The imported goods are often intended for exhibition purposes, testing purposes or presenting to potential customers. The goods remain under customs control until the re-export.
Goods imported with the customs procedure of temporary importation are subject to the provision of security with limited exemptions. The security covers duty and taxes and will be calculated on the base of the customs value used for a declaration for free circulation. The security has to be paid on deposit by the importer prior to release. The security will be paid back by customs when re-exporting the goods under customs control.
The invoice must clearly state that the goods are being temporarily imported but not for processing or repair. It will be also useful to put the reason of import on the invoice. Customs inspections might be possible.
In order for the importer to reclaim the security goods, the shipment must be re-exported under the temporarily import / export procedure.
We highly recommend to check, before shipping, with the local destination Brokerage department, if this service can be provided (in most cases when a security has to be provided, UPS does not) and if the additional costs applicable will be in line with the value of shipment or if the costs will be even higher than paying duties and taxes. Taxes can be reclaimed from businesses.
If service cannot be provided through UPS, the consignee has to name an alternate broker for the customs procedure of temporary importation.
Military Shipments
UPS is not a registered carrier for deliveries to Overseas Military Bases in the United Kingdom. This may result in shipments not being able to be delivered and eventually being returned.
Deliveries cannot be made to BFPO (British Forces) addresses in the United Kingdom.
The shipper should use their normal mail service which then flows into Royal Mail, who can deal with these shipments because they are a registered carrier and there are no duty or taxes to pay. UPS is not a registered carrier.
Returned Goods
The import of goods exported within the last two years can be done without duty and VAT. The items must be in the same state like they were at the time of export.
The invoice and the ""Special Instructions Box"" of the UPS Waybill must include the following information:
The words ""return goods""
Country or Territory of origin
Reason for the return (for example, ""not in accordance to contract"", or ""credit"")
Export entry number, date & export port (for example, EMA)
Samples
Shipments can be classified as commercial samples only if the consignee is a business and holds a valid EORI and the purpose of the shipment is to secure future orders. It must be clear that the product can only be used as a commercial sample. The goods must meet either criteria A or B below and Customs may insist that one or more of the additional criteria C, D or E be applied also to allow duty and tax relief:
A. The goods can be either defaced in some way (torn, perforated or slashed) and / or:
B. Using permanent indelible marking or permanent labelling to clearly mark the item as a Commercial Sample
In addition to the above, HMRC may also insist that one or all of the following methods be applied as well:
C. Limit the quantities of items (for example, single shoes, single sizes)
D. Limit the frequency or occasions the items are imported within a twelve month period
E. Use an acceptable method of presentation that restricts the handling of the goods so that they can only be used to demonstrate them as proper commercial samples
A complete description of the sample, including whether it is marked or mutilated must be included on the invoice. Shipments of goods for personal use or goods intended for sale cannot be classified as samples. For further details please visit www.gov.uk and refer to public notice 372.
Warranty Shipments
Please see 'Outward Processing' if the goods were repaired in the country or territory of dispatch or 'Inward Processing' if the repair should be done in Great Britain.
WEEE and RoHS
The European Union implemented a directive restricting the use of certain hazardous substances in all Electronic & Electrical Equipment effective July 1, 2006. This directive is called the RoHS Directive (2005/618/EC), which stands for the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment.
The RoHS directive is closely linked with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) 2002/96/EC which sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for electrical goods.
These directives will ban the placing on the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) (PBB and PBDE are flame retardants used in some plastics).
Manufacturers (and distributors and individual sellers) will need to understand the requirements of the RoHS/WEEE Directives to ensure that their products, and their components, comply. Goods falling under these categories do not require any accompanying documentation for importation.
For more information on the EU directives, please check the following European Union web link or contact your local chamber of commerce: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/faq_weee.pdf
Outward Processing (after repair)
In order to qualify for any exemption from duties and taxes, certain documentation relating to the initial export of the goods must be submitted with the import entry. The initial export entry must have been correctly processed to indicate that the goods were exported for repair. If the export documentation is either incorrect or not available, duties and / or VAT will be payable on the value of the goods and any repair costs.
To ensure that shipments of repaired goods can be readily identified, the invoice must clearly state ""repaired goods"" (please also list it in the ""Special Instructions Box"" of the UPS Waybill) and include the commodity's value before the repair as well as the cost of the repair and the spare parts.
Inward Processing (Repair & Return)
The customs procedure of inward processing is used for goods who are supposed to be repaired inside the European Union and re-exported after repair. The import procedure requires customs control until the correct re-export of the goods.
The importer is obliged to re-export the items during the period granted for repair within the import declaration for inward processing. If the re-export fails within this given period duty and VAT become due. Customs inspections with the import and re-export clearance is possible.
The invoice must clearly state that goods are being imported for the purpose of repair or processing. Additional costs may apply if the importer is not authorized.
For re-exportation the import entry details are needed if the importer is not authorized. If the exporter is authorized please provide the IPR authorization number. A full export declaration is needed prior to goods being exported from the UK.
Other Shipment Types
Amendment issued by the Indian Government with effect from 4th April 2020 prohibits diagnostic kits ITC HS Code 3822 for export from India.
Solid Wood Packing Material
New requirements have been implemented for both small package and WWEF shipments and are based on the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 15, which is entitled ""Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade"". ISPM 15 was adopted internationally in 2002, and is gradually being introduced by countries or territories worldwide. Wood or wood products covered by ISPM 15 include items such as packing cases, boxes, crates, drums or similar packing, pallets, box pallets and other load boards, pallet collars and skids, but exclude such processed woods as orientated strand board, particle board, plywood or veneer, created using glue, heat and pressure or a combinations thereof, and, raw wood which is 6mm or less thick. It is recommended that if a question arises on this issue, please check with the authority that issues the Phytosanitary certificates in your country or territory.
Personal Shipments
For shipments of personal used/household effects items where the shipper is transferring residence/relocating to the United Kingdom, a form (TOR01) needs to be completed on line. Such an application must be made prior to shipping any consignments of household effects and personal property to UK. If successful in obtaining ToR relief, the applicant will then be awarded a unique declaration information code that they or their third party agent must then quote on the Customs entry declaration form.
An example of the form is in ""Forms"" section of Worldcom."
