        "Content": "Steel License\nA steel licensing system has been instituted to facilitate the monitoring of certain steel imports. Under the \"reasonable care\" guidelines, it is the responsibility of the Importer or the Importer's Broker to obtain a steel license on all entries for consumption of covered steel products.\nYou can apply for a license up to 60 days prior to the expected date of importation.\nFor more information, contact the Import Administration or see http://www.ia.ita.doc.gov/steel/license\nThe filer must print the license at the time of filing. The Department of Commerce will e-mail confirmation of the application and license number.\nThe fee for an application or an Import License is US$21.75.\nThe license is valid for 75 days and cannot be reused.\nA single license can only be presented with one Entry Summary (CBP 7501) and may cover multiple products if the Importer/Exporter, Manufacturer, and Country or Territory of Origin remain the same. A separate license will be required if the information differs.\nThe one exception to the Steel License and Surge Monitoring Program will be \"informal\" entries. Informal entries are shipments valued at between US$200.00 and US$2,500.00.\nFor licensing purposes, an informal entry is defined as:\nA value not exceeding US$2,500.00 when using a Chapter 72 or 73 HTSUS#\nNote: Informal entries included in a formal entry will require a license.\nConsumer Prod SafetyImprovement Act\nNew import requirements for consumer goods took effect on November 12, 2008.\nBeginning on that date importers must certify in writing that products being imported for warehousing and/or consumption conform to the rules, bans, regulations or standards administered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).\nThe new requirements apply to nearly all categories of consumer goods, including:\nfabrics\nwearing apparel\ntoys\njewelry\nsporting goods\nfurniture\nhazardous material\nall-terrain vehicles\neven pharmaceuticals subject to child-resistant cap standards\nThe new certificate of conformity guidelines:\nOnly the importer must issue the certificate.\nForeign manufacturers and private labelers of imported products do not need to issue certificates, and they do not need to be listed as parties on certificates. For products manufactured in the United States, only the domestic manufacturer needs to issue the certificate.\nThe certificate, in hard copy or electronic form, must be available to the CPSC no later than the time the shipment is available for inspection in the U.S.\nThe certificate must contain the following information:\nIdentification of the product covered by the certificate;\nCitation to each CPSC regulation to which the product is being certified;\nIdentification of the importer (or domestic manufacturer, as applicable) certifying compliance (including name of company, full mailing address, and phone number).\nContact information for individual maintaining the test results, including the person\u001as name, email address, full mailing address, and phone number.\nDate (at least month and year) and place (including city and country or territory or administrative region) where the product was manufactured. If the same manufacturer operates more than one location in the same city, the street address of the factory in question should be provided.\nDate and place (including city and country or territory or administrative region) where the product was tested for compliance with the cited regulation.\nIdentification of any third-party lab on whose testing the certification depends, including name, full mailing address and phone number.\nCPSC recommends that each issuer maintain test records supporting the certification for at least three years.\nPower of Attorney\nPower of Attorney (POA) is obtained to transfer the liability for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) compliance to the importer. If the POA has been properly executed, the importer is responsible for default of further obligations to CBP.\nIt is essential that the following guidelines be followed in order to limit the potential liability of UPS SCS when it otherwise may qualify as an Importer of Record (IOR) for all service levels associated with the small package operations.\nThese guidelines are not intended to cover all possible scenarios that might require UPS SCS to obtain a POA from a customer. Some examples that might change the decision as to whether to obtain a POA include:\nWhen customer is the subject of a CBP penalty or another government agency investigation\nIf UPS SCS has been penalized by CBP or another government agency for inaccurate information furnished by customer\nWhen customers credit history is poor\nWhen the customers shipment values fluctuate without adequate explanation\nPOA Requirements for all service levels\nPOA is required from the customer when the entered value of a single shipment exceeds $50,000 USD.\nIn the following cases a POA is required regardless of shipments entered values:\nAll Temporary Import Bonds (TIB)\nAny shipment that is similar to a shipment that Customs has found not to be legally marked under the country or territory of origin marking laws (i.e. Not Legally Marked (NLMs)).\nShipments requiring a conditional release from Participating Government Agencies (PGA) such as Food & Drug Administration and Fish & Wildlife Service\nFormal commercial shipments containing finished tobacco products, alcoholic beverages\nProducts subject to antidumping or countervailing duty orders\nShipments subject to the Lacey Act where UPS files the declaration\nShipments subject to Free Trade Agreements containing textiles\nImport Declaration\nAny shipment that is a U.S. good returning and has a value over US$10,000.00 requires the presentation of a Manufacturer's Affidavit to Customs.\nMSDS-NON DG\nGoods under IATA Special Provisions A67 require a MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet).\nIt is not required for all, however shipments can be held by local authority in United Arab Emirates after screening due to lack of MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) or NON DG (Dangerous Goods) declaration letter from the shipper resulting to misconnections and impacting end-to-end service.\nIt would be advisable for all shipments originating, transiting and terminating for UAE to have MSDS or NON DG declaration from shipper enclosed in the shipment and copies to be uploaded in IDIS.",

In addition, the importation of carpets and other textile floor coverings of Iranian origin that are classified under chapter 57 or heading 9706.00.0060 of the HTS are also authorized.\nHowever, due to the additional Iran sanctions recently passed by Congress, OFAC will soon issue a regulation amending the Iranian Transaction Regulations to eliminate the general license and such imports will be no longer permitted starting on September 29, 2010. OFAC has also indicated that any authorized Iranian products must be imported by September 28, 2010 and it will not issue any specific licenses authorizing any imports after that date. As a result, importers must move quickly to ensure that any pending orders are entered for consumption by their customs brokers by September 28, 2010.\nRestricted Articles\nU.S. Customs & Border Protection enforces laws relating to the protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).

This occurs when, after prescribed time limits expire, goods remain unentered into the commerce of the U.S. After time limits expire, goods may be moved into a general order storage facility under Customs custody.\nCritical Time Limits\n15 calendar days from the date of arrival imported goods are deemed G.O. eligible by CBP. UPS Operations/Carrier will notify CBP on the 15th calendar day after the date of arrival of any shipment that has not been presented for entry. CBP will then make the determination to move the freight to the G.O. warehouse.\nG.O. goods stay in CBP custody in a bonded warehouse for six months from the date of arrival before they are considered unclaimed or abandoned. At that time, CBP may auction the product to recover expenses associated with the G.O.\nWithdrawing Goods from a G.O. Warehouse\nImporters have six months from the date of importation to export general order merchandise. Storage and handling fees apply.\nImporters may also enter the goods under a consumption entry or any other type entry.

If the exemption above is not met, the shipment will not be admissible for import.\nFish and Wildlife clearance encompasses all wildlife, whether animal or animal byproduct.\nTo clear through this government agency, the shipper must provide a detailed description on the invoice of the products and include the Latin scientific name (genus and species), country of origin of the animal, and source code (wild, farmed, ranched). The invoice must also include the country of origin of the product and a fair market cost of the goods.\nFor commercial entries exported to the US, the US Importer is required to have a current US Fish & Wildlife Import/Export permit. Commercial shipments MUST be delivered to the license holder. Personal shipments do not require a USFW import/export permit. A Fish and Wildlife Declaration (Form 3-177) will need to be entered by the broker or the importer for all shipments containing wildlife.\nIf applicable, the shipper will need to apply for any additional permits required by the export country such as a CITES (www.cites.org), BFAR, or MBTA.\nThe package must be marked with the names and address of the consignee and shipper. It must also contain a list of the wildlife with its scientific name. Packages MUST be marked as containing Fish and Wildlife regulated commodities. If the packages are not properly marked, The Fish and Wildlife Service could assess a fine of up to US$350.00.\nPlease access the following link to view charges incurred for Fish and Wildlife clearance:\nFish and Wildlife Inspection Fee Chart\nUPS Special Handling charge: US$25.00 per shipment.\nPlease be aware, the Fish and Wildlife Service prohibits the importation of certain animals and animal products. This list includes but is not limited to: Sea turtles, Ivory, Furs (wild cats, seals, sea otter, etc.), Birds, Primates, Reptiles and reptilian leathers. Each of these items has its own exceptions, please visit www.fws.gov for more information. Tuesday, May 28, 2013 The Fish and Wildlife Service announced May 22 that until further notice it will prohibit the following with respect to trade in protected species of wild animals and plants. - Commercial import or introduction from the sea from, and the commercial export or reexport to, Guinea of specimens listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora - All imports and introduction from the sea from, and all exports or reexports to, Afghanistan, Djibouti and Lesotho of CITES-listed specimens The FWS states that all such prohibited shipments or specimens are subject to refusal of import/export or seizure and forfeiture. These prohibitions are being imposed because the countries or territories listed have failed to implement the required CITES legislation or file the required annual reports on their implementation of CITES. The U.S. therefore cannot establish the legal origin of wildlife that is exported or reexported from these countries or territories and also cannot allow trade to these countries or territories since the necessary enforcement provisions are not in place to ensure the CITES treaty is being implemented.\nDietary Supplements\nDietary supplements, vitamins and herbal supplements may be regulated in the destination country or territory. Therefore, U.S. shippers should contact the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to inquire about the various document requirements prior to exporting their products.\nThe importer in the destination country or territory should verify importing regulations with the appropriate government agency that regulates these commodities. U.S. and international shippers must include the Lot Numbers of the vitamins and dietary and herbal supplements on the export shipping invoice.\nNOTE: U.S. origin dietary supplements, vitamins, and herbal supplements containing animal products and/or animal by-products that are being returned to the U.S. are still regulated by USDA/APHIS and FDA. The U.S. exporting invoice must accompany the returning shipment.\nAdditional information can be found in the Animal Product Manual under Special Procedures Table 2-4-21. The Animal Product Manual is located at: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/plants/manuals/ports/downloads/apm_pdf/02_04specproc.pdf\nMedicine (also see Drugs)\nIt is illegal to import medicine without FDA approval. Shipments of medicine without FDA approval will be refused entry and will be returned to the export location or destroyed.\nAllow one extra day for inspection by the FDA.\nNote: The FDA can decide not to take action against the illegal importation.\nU.S. Citizens\nU.S. citizens may be allowed to import unapproved medicine for personal use if these factors apply:\nThe medicine is intended for a serious condition for which treatment may not be available in the U.S.\nThe FDA does not consider the product a risk.\nThe individual seeking to import the drug affirms in writing that it is for the patient's own use and provides the name and address of the U.S. doctor responsible for treatment.\nNon-U.S. Citizens\nNon-U.S. citizens may be allowed to import unapproved medicine from their country or territory of birth for personal use if these factors apply:\nThe FDA does not consider the product a risk.\nThe individual can provide the generic or common name of the medicine, the scientific name of the medicine, the name and address of the manufacturer, and the intended use of the medicine.\nThe product is for personal use, not for resale, and is a three-month supply or less.\nThe individual can provide Customs with proof of foreign citizenship at time of entry.\nCommercial Shipments\nCommercial shipments of medicine pre-approved by the FDA require the following on the invoice:\nGeneric or common name of product\nScientific name of product\nName and address of manufacturer\nIntended use of product\nCommercial shipments of medicine not pre-approved by the FDA require the following on the invoice:\nGeneric or common name of product\nScientific name of product\nName and address of manufacturer\nInvestigations New Drug Number or New Drug Application Number\nTextile Declaration\nA Textile Declaration is no longer required for textile and apparel shipments entering the United States. In lieu of the Textile Declaration, CBP requires the shipper to report the complete name and address information of the manufacturer for each article within the shipment. Other information formerly on the Textile Declaration is still required on the Commercial Invoice or other supporting documentation, including the fabric content, whether the article is knitted or woven, the weight and dimensions of fabric, and gender.\nStorage Media Devices\nPortable storage media devices shipped commercially containing software, music, video or pictures are subject to duty and require a commercial invoice.\nLaminated Woven Sacks\nAnti-dumping duties apply to Laminated Woven Sacks which are produced in People's Republic of China(PRC) or (CN), Kyrgyzstan(KG), India(IN), Pakistan(PK), Vietnam(VN), South Korea(KR), Hong Kong(HK) and Taiwan(TW).\nThese are subject to antidumping duties (ADD) and countervailing duties (CVD). The Laminated Woven Sacks ADD/CVD Compliance Worksheet is necessary to obtain information, when the Invoice, Standard Operating Procedures(SOP), Parts Database, or Customer Profile Comments does not provide sufficient information to classify the product and determine if anti-dumping duties apply.\nTuna\nNOAA form 370 is required to ship Tuna to the United States unless it is fresh Tuna. Please see below the link to get the form needed for import.\nhttp://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/dolphinsafe/importation_2.htm#top\nRosewood\nImport Shipments Containing Rosewood:\nU.S. imports of rosewood - only manufactured items (e.g., furniture, musical instruments, car interiors) are allowed if the shipper provides a validated (signed) Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) permit for export from the shipper\u001as origin country or territory.\nBaby Formula\nBaby formula is a commodity regulated by FDA and requires submission at all values.\nMFG needs to have food facility registration number with US FDA (should be indicated on invoice if possible)\nLot number is required (usually can be found on labelling but should be indicated on invoice if possible)\nManufacturer MUST be provided\nIf above conditions are not met, shipment is likely to be detained if not refused by FDA upon submission of entry.\nInfant Formula\nPlease see \"Baby Formula\"\nOrganic (BIO) Products\nEffective March 19, 2024, all imported products that are described, labeled, and/or marketed as organic require reporting of a 21-digit organic certificate number by the USDA AMS National Organic Program (NOP). \nRussian Origin Salmon\nRussian origin salmon, cod, pollock or crab harvested in Russia or substantially transformed into another product in another country is prohibited.\nFood\nIf a shipment prompts for FSIS and contains items such as meat, poultry, fish, or eggs, these items require FSIS inspection. Exemption =50lbs or less and a personal shipment. If the exemption above is not met, the shipment will not be admissible for import.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made some changes to its regulations on the submission of prior notice for imported food. Changes to the prior notice regulations:\nRemoves the requirement that the identity of the anticipated border crossing within the port of arrival be provided in the prior notice\nRemoves the requirement to provide the 6 digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule number in the prior notice\nRequires the registration number of the manufacturer (or the full address of the manufacturer and a reason) in all circumstances\nThe final rule will require the PN (prior notice) to include the name and full address of the shipper, if the shipper is different from the manufacturer (in order to eliminate duplicative requirements)\nIdentity of the manufacturer, for food no longer in its natural state (for commercial shipments):\nThe final rule will revise the PN information requirements in 21 CFR 1.281(a)(6) for an article of food that is no longer in its natural state, to require the name of the manufacturer and either:\nThe registration number, city and country or territory of the manufacturer or\nBoth the full address of the manufacturer and the reason the registration number is not provided\nIdentity of manufacturer if such food sent as a personal gift:\nThe final rule will revise the PN information requirements for an article of food that is no longer in its natural state to remove the current option that allows the name and address that appears on the label under 21 CFR 101.5 to be submitted instead of the name, address, and registration number of the manufacturer for food sent by an individual as a personal gift (i.e., for non-business reasons) to an individual in the U.S. Prior Notice is not required for home-made non-commercial food shipments shipped by an individual, to an individual, as gifts for personal use. Furthermore, current FDA policy is not to require Prior Notice when food purchased at a commercial establishment is exported or offered for export by a non-commercial shipper for a non-commercial purpose (i.e., from an individual, to an individual, as a gift or as a household good for personal use). Additional exclusion criteria can be found at the FDA web site.\nRequirements to Submit Prior Notice of Imported Food:\nSubmitter and transmitter\nDeadlines for Prior Notice Submitting\nPrior Notice General Information Requirements\nRegistration Numbers\nGrower Identity\nProduct Identity\nChanges to Prior Notice Submissions\nChanges to Shipments\nPNSI and ACS/ABI Features Confirmation\nUPS completes Prior Notice on behalf of shipper for $10.00 USD. IF shipper would like to obtain an have on file they may find additional information at Filing Prior Notice of Imported Foods\nTextiles\nCustoms and Border Protection has recently issued an administrative message TBT-09-007 \"Amendment to Formal Entry Requirements for Textiles\".\nAs a result, current procedures for textile entries will change according to the following guidelines:\nTextiles valued at $200.49 or less should be processed as a Section 321.\nTextiles valued between $200.50 and $250.49 should be processed as Informal.\nTextiles valued over $250.49 should be submitted as Formal.\nWith the elimination of the visa arrangements, the provision that allows for properly marked commercial samples no longer applies. Samples entering the United States must now meet the mutilated samples guidelines as described in HTS chapter 98 under subheading 9811.00.60.\nA few limited entry type exceptions, for example imports for U.S. Government Agencies, all U.S. Import entries value over $2500.49 USD require the Importer of Record to have Customs Bond. So, a presumption must be made that all private entities acting as importer of record must have a bond. The bond is the financial guarantee payable to U.S. Customs as sole beneficiary that import entry will be made, completed, lawful duties, and fees paid, and compliance with all applicable U.S. laws.\nFor textiles to the U.S. if FTA is not claimed then UPS may be importer of record, up to $50,000.49 USD. Therefore, the consignee is not required to give UPS POA. Subsequently, they are not required to secure bond in there name. UPS assumes liability as importer of record and UPS's bond guarantees the entry.\nFor textiles to the U.S. valued over $200.49 USD if FTA is claimed, except for NAFTA eligible shipments via certain modes of transport, then UPS may not be importer of record. UPS must secure the POA from the consignee, or other financially interested party, to make entry in their name. That party as importer of record must have a bond in their name. If a continuous bond is not already on file then UPS will execute single transaction bond in their name based on the POA's authority. A single transaction bond will carry a $4 premium charge per $1000 in surety coverage, rounded up, with a minimum of $40 USD. So a shipment bonded up to $10,000 USD will be covered by the $40.00 minimum.\nCD Roms\nA CD Rom and other portable storage media shipped commercially containing software, music, video or pictures are subject to duty and require a commercial invoice.\nPencils\nAnti-dumping duties apply to pencils manufactured in China.\nHelical Spring Lock Washers\nAnti-dumping duties apply to helical spring lock washers manufactured in China and Taiwan.\nInfrared Products\nThese items require FDA clearance.\nLaser Products\nThese items require FDA clearance.\nRadio Frequency Devices\nAnything that is electronic, battery-operated, or capable of sending, receiving, or interfering with radio signals may be considered a radio-frequency device. Examples of such devices include radio and TV receivers, converters, transmitters, transmitting devices, radio frequency amplifiers, microwave ovens, industrial heaters, ultrasonic transceivers, and computers.\nPrior to July 1, 2016, importers were required to file FCC Form 740, Section 2.1203 \u001a General Requirement for Entry, and Section 2.1205 \u001a Filing of Required Declaration, along with their customs entry documentation.\nAs of July 1, 2016, the preceding requirement has been temporarily suspended, (see FCC-15-135A1). A proposal is being considered to permanently discontinue the requirement to file an FCC Form 740. (see (FCC 15-92).The suspension of FCC Form 740 only eliminates the requirement to file the form.\nImportation of radio frequency equipment still requires that the product:\n(1) Has the required FCC equipment authorization;\n(2) Is only being imported for evaluation;\n(3) Is only being imported for demonstration at a trade show; or\n(4) Meets one of the conditions as permitted in Section 2.1204 (see Question 3 of the Equipment Authorization \u001a Importation website).\nFor more information, see the \u001aEquipment Authorization - Importation\u001a website.\nGift Cards\nPlastic Gift Cards 4911.99.8000 per Customs Ruling W968266\nTextiles - Manufacturer's ID\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) has eliminated the need for Textile Declaration for textile and wearing apparel goods into the U.S. Instead CBP has amended the reporting requirements for importers to identify the manufacturer of textile and apparel products through a manufacturer identification code (MID). The MID is a critical element of an importer's obligation to report information to CBP on customs entries. The MID is formulated by UPS Supply Chain Solutions using information provided by the U.S. importer. For textile and apparel products subject to the updated Declaration regulations, the importer will now be required to furnish sufficient information to meet the new MID requirements. These requirements are to provide the following:\nFull name and address of the manufacturer performing the country or territory of origin conferring operations of each textile and apparel product.\nWhen textile and apparel products from multiple manufacturers are contained in a shipment, the full name and address of each manufacturer performing the country or territory of origin conferring operations must be identified separately.\nA detailed description and information is imperative to ensure compliance since the regulations clearly state that the importer must be able to demonstrate their use of reasonable care in determining who the manufacturer is that performs the country or territory of origin conferring operations.\nAlthough CBP has eliminated the Textile Declaration, the new MID procedures call for additional compliance measures by importers. If a MID does not meet the new requirements, CBP can deny entry of the shipment and, possibly, impose penalties for failure to exercise reasonable care. As a consequence, together with their suppliers, importers should have procedures in place to ensure proper identification of the entity that performs the country or territory of origin conferring operations and to communicate that information to UPS Supply Chain Solutions.",
