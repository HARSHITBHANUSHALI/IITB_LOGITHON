        "Content": "Import License\nCustoms may require an import license for certain products from certain countries or territories, depending on the harmonized tariff code.\nThe importer must obtain the import license. An original export license from the exporter of the country or territory of origin might be necessary to obtain the import license.\nThe requirement of an import license is dependent on the country or territory of origin of the goods not the country or territory of export. For further detailed information it is highly recommended to contact your chamber of commerce.\nDeclaration of Conformity\nDeclaration of Conformity (CE marking)\nThe European Community require certain standards on product safety for certain types of goods. The range of products covered by the directives must comply with the applicable directives when it is placed on the community market for the first time or put into use. Placing on the market in the meaning of the directives is the action of making a product available for the first time, either for payment or free of charge. 'Putting into service' takes place at the moment of first use within the Community by the end user (for example, produced for own use of the importer).\nRange of products\nThe most important products are toys, in-vitro diagnostic medical devices, medical devices, machinery, low voltage equipment, safety devices (for example, helmets), exhaust systems and electromagnetic compatibility.For a full overview please see the EU website:\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2022:247:TOC\nResponsibilities\nManufacturers are defined as the persons responsible for designing and manufacturing products supposed to be placed on the EU market. The manufacturer has an obligation to ensure that a product intended to be placed on the Community market is designed and manufactured, and it's conformity assessed, to the essential requirements in accordance with the provisions of the directives. The manufacturer may appoint any natural or legal person, established in the European Union, to act on his behalf as an authorized representative.\nThe authorized representative may be addressed by the authorities of the member states in regard to the manufacturer's obligations.\nThe importer is defined as any legal or natural person responsible for placing products on the EU market. He is responsible to provide the market surveillance authority with the necessary information about the safety of the product and a copy of the Declaration of Conformity (DoC). If the manufacturer is established in the EU or has a so called authorized representative it is his obligation to provide the necessary information.\nConformity Assessment Procedure\nGoods subject to the regulations on product safety need to be tested according to the rules applying for each group of products. Manufacturers have to draw up an EC declaration of conformity which is the first step of the conformity assessment procedure. The declaration of conformity has to include technical information containing the way of testing and the steps to be taken to obtain the attestation of conformity. The way of testing and steps to be taken depends on the type of product. If the testing was successful the producer is allowed to apply the so called 'CE sign' on the product or where this is not applicable (for example, surgical instruments) at the retail package or on a \"Declaration of Conformity\" certificate.\nThe \"Declaration of Conformity\" has to be issued by a notified body certified by a member state of the European Union.\nNotified Body\nA notified body is an organization certified by the national government to carry out the tasks of the conformity assessment procedures. They can offer their service to any economic operator inside and outside the European Community. They can carry out the tests or monitor the tests carried out by the manufacturer. They can carry out these activities inside the EU or on the territory of third countries or territories.\nInformation about notified bodies and notified bodies itself can be found on the EU website:\nhttps://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/compliance/conformity-assessment/index_en.htm\nFor additional information, please also refer to \"Product Safety\".\nProduct Safety\nMarket Surveillance\nMarket Surveillance is organized and performed at national level. Each member state is responsible for surveillance activities on its territory. Customs authorities are usually part of the market surveillance activities. On customs request the \"Declaration of Conformity\" has to be provided by the shipper, the manufacturer or his assigned representative in the EU or the importer.P> Declaration of Conformity\nThe Declaration of Conformity (DoC) is a document in which the manufacturer, or his authorized representative within the EU, indicates that the product meets all the necessary requirements of the directives applicable for the specific product. The DoC shall contain the name and the address of the manufacturer along with information about the product (for example, brand and serial number). The DoC must be signed by an individual working for the manufacturer or his authorized representative.\nOn request the manufacturer or his authorized representative within the EU must provide the DoC. In case the manufacturer is not an EU entity and has no authorized representative, the importer must be able to provide a copy of the DoC and additional proofs if requested.\nNational Requirements\nFor some commodities the conformity with the product safety regulations must be declared by the importer within the customs declaration. The DoC is required as a valid proof for the safety of the products and their compliance with the directives.\nThese commodities are everything with CE marking, like:\ntoys\nelectronic equipment\nradio & telecommunication equipment\nmedical devices\nsunglasses\nchemical substances\nmeasuring devices\npressure equipment\npyrotechnic articles\nExceptions are shipments to private individuals with no CE checking.\nSpot checks are carried out. If Customs finds goods without CE marking, the considered goods are seized until further decision is met. This can take several weeks. Goods are no longer under UPS control. In case a matching DOC is provided, goods can be released or goods can be given to inspection from T\u00dcV (charged with 300 Euros per item to be checked).\nCustoms procedure time is between 1-6 weeks.\nFree Trade Agreements\nBilateral free trade agreements or unilateral autonomous preferential agreements allow the import clearance of certain products with a reduced duty rate or with a full duty exemption. The products benefiting from the preferential treatment must fulfil the necessary rules of originating in a country or territory covered by the preferential trade agreement.\nAn exporter who wants his products to benefit from the preferential treatment must be able to proof that his products fulfil the rules to be originating in a country or territory covered by the preferential trade agreement and they must provide a preferential document validated by the customs authorities or document with a valid preferential statement issued by themselves.\nThe preferential trade agreement foresees the following preferential proofs above.\nImport Control System 2 (ICS2)\nOn March 1, 2023, the European Union launched Release 2 of their Import Control System 2 (ICS2) for goods transported by air to EU (European Union) destinations plus Norway, Northern Ireland and Switzerland (regardless of origin).\nWhat is ICS2?\nThe Import Control System 2 (ICS2) is the second phase of electronic customs import system for the EU. This upgraded IT system is created to collect data about all goods entering the EU prior to their arrival. ICS2 aims to better protect Europes single market and its citizens with new customs safety and security measures and will facilitate free flow of trade through improved data-driven customs security processes that are adapted to global business models.\nICS2 is required for all shipments transiting via any EU country even if final destination is not a part of the EU, i.e. a shipment from Asia to the UK, where the goods are transiting via any EU country.\nImporters are required to provide a six-digit Harmonized System (HS) code for each commodity line listed in the commercial invoice and/or detailed goods descriptions for the shipments to avoid potential delays, fines or penalties and facilitate customs clearance. Where more than one HS code is present, the net weight of each is also required. The Economic Operators Registration and Identification Number (EORI) for the shipment recipient / consignee is also mandatory.\nWhen tendering a shipment to UPS Supply Chain Solutions destined to or via the EU, the following information is mandatory:\nShipper name, Shipper address, Recipient name, Recipient address, Number of packages, Gross weight, Acceptable goods description (see the full EU guidelines), Six-digit Harmonized System (HS) codes along with net weight of each where there is more than a single HS code involved. For EU-27, the recipients EORI number (see the full EU guidelines).\nIn a case where customers provide insufficient data to complete ICS2 data reporting requirements, UPS SCS will make a commercially reasonable effort to contact customers. If a shipper does not respond, the shipment would be held at the origin until all requirements are received.\nLetters, correspondence and other document shipments of no commercial value are excluded from this requirement. For more information on HS Codes, check out our Importers Guide to HTS Codes.\nFor more information on ICS2, please visit the European Commission website.\nCertificate of Origin\nA certificate of origin is not required for the import clearance of textiles.\nThe country or territory of origin must be stated on the invoice for each invoice line.

General descriptions of goods, such as \"clothes\" or \"garments,\" will not be accepted.\nox 4 \"Country of origin\" / Box 5 \"Country of destination\"\nIf the goods originate in the European Community or if the country of destination is in the European Community, care must be taken to indicate the European Community and not the individual Member State in heading 4 or 5. This also applies if only the individual Member State is noted in a previous proof of origin. The additional indication of a Member State, e.g. as \"EU/Germany\", is tolerated.\nForm A\nA Form A is only valid for imports from countries or territories covered by the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).

Hence, shipments for exhibitions - which are normally time sensitive - should preferably have UPS Billing Option \"Free Domicile\" in order to avoid possible delays in delivery due to payment issues in the destination country or territory. Even if the billing option is Free Domicile it is highly recommended that shippers attach a confirmation that they are willing to pay the German import charges in case they incur.

There are two types of antibodies, the monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies.\nMonoclonal antibodies are generated in vitro. Tissue from animals are taken (e.g. blood) and infected with certain substances or pathogens. The blood cells react with the production of antibodies which are than harvested and used for the production of the test kits. Due to the in vitro production and the controlled way of production those types of test kits are not subject to veterinarian control if it is a commercial production.\nPolyclonal antibodies are gained from living animals like rabbits. They are infected with the substances / pathogens and the animals are producing antibodies. The antibodies are harvested from the blood stream of the animals. Test reagents with polyclonal antibodies are subject to vet inspections.\nShipment documents (commercial invoice or declaration on letterhead) should include:\n\u001a the place of origin of the material\n\u001a the quantity of the material, in weight or volume\n\u001a a description of the material/ animal source\n\u001a catalogue number and price (if available)\n\u001a additives (e.g., sodium azide, glycerol), their source (e.g., whole serum, supernatant, ascites), and purification, if any.\n\u001a protocols \u001a the recommended protocol or datasheet indicating any unique fixation, detergent, blocking, or incubation conditions.\n\u001a the intended use (commercial/ manufacturing; research/ testing)\n\u001a the name and address of the shipper\n\u001a the name and address of the receiver\nCommercially packaged, ready-to-use In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) containing products of animal of origin, do not require a Vet-inspection, if compliant with Directive 98/79/EC on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices. A declaration of conformity (CE-marking) must be provided for each individual commodity (e.g. reagents, test kits, immunosorbent assays such as ELISA kits).\nParts\nThe invoice must include a description of the part, the machine for which the part will be used, and a list of the part's components.\nFood\nCertain food products (for example, figs, nuts, spices) are subject to inspection at authorized customs offices only. They can not be imported at the UPS import site. They must be returned or forwarded under bond to another customs broker assigned by the importer. Additional costs apply.\nA veterinarian inspection or a Health Certificate may be required to import processed food depending on the percentage of animal products contained. A veterinarian determines the requirements for an inspection or Health Certificate based on the percentage of egg, meat, fish, milk, and milk products (especially cheese). The percentages of egg, milk, milk products, fish and meat should be stated on the invoice to support customs clearance.\nBrokerage accessorial charges will apply and an import delay may occur.\nBased on the EU regulation 2009/669/EC certain foodstuffs (for example tea with origin China) imported from certain third countries or territories are subject to increased level of official controls due to contamination risks of these products by aflatoxinson and pathogens. These controls are carried out at Designated Point of Entries (DPE) defined by each member state.\nThe import of feed and food originating in or consigned from Japan following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station and not subject to vet inspection can only be imported into the EU through Designated Point of Entries (DPE). They must be accompanied by a declaration attesting that the goods are either harvested or processed before March 11, 2011, originated from a prefecture other than the ones affected by higher levels of radiation or if originated from an affected prefecture have been subjected to laboratory analysis determining the level of certain radionuclides (regulation 2011/297/EC).\nThe customs office responsible for our import sites are not defined as DPE. Commodities subject to import controls at a DPE can't be imported with UPS.\nBooks\nIt\u001as recommended to mention a detailed description of the book (title, author or ISBN number if available) on the commercial invoice, in order to avoid clearance delays.",

        "Content": "Temporary Import\nWithin the customs procedure of temporary importation, goods designated to be imported for a limited stretch of time and remaining in the same state can be cleared without duty and VAT. The imported goods are often intended for exhibition purposes, testing purposes or presenting to potential customers. The goods remain under customs control until the re-export.\nGoods imported with the customs procedure of temporary importation are subject to the provision of security with limited exemptions. The security covers duty and taxes and will be calculated on the base of the customs value used for a declaration for free circulation. The security has to be paid on deposit by the importer prior to release. The security will be paid back by customs when re-exporting the goods under customs control.\nThe invoice must clearly state that the goods are being temporarily imported but not for processing or repair. It will be also useful to put the reason of import on the invoice. Customs inspections might be possible.\nIn order for the importer to reclaim the security goods, the shipment must be re-exported under the temporarily import / export procedure.\nWe highly recommend to check, before shipping, with the local destination Brokerage department, if this service can be provided (in most cases when a security has to be provided, UPS does not) and if the additional costs applicable will be in line with the value of shipment or if the costs will be even higher than paying duties and taxes. Taxes can be reclaimed from businesses.\nPlease be informed that clearance with a so-called-CARNET ATA-is not offered by destination Brokerage in Germany.\nIf service cannot be provided through UPS, the consignee has to name an alternate broker for the customs procedure of temporary importation.\nMilitary Shipments\nShipments where the consignee is the NATO Armed Forces and is for NATO use require an Army Form 302 from the consignee (army). The invoice should state \"Military Shipment\" to make clearance easier. All shipments destined to the United States Armed Forces need an approval of the US Customs Clearance Office (CCO) prior to clearance. The COO issues the Army Form AE 302 for army goods only. Shipments destined to companies not covered by the NATO regulations have to be cleared as normal import shipments. Shipments destined to individual members of the NATO Armed Forces for their personal use need to be cleared within another procedure (see 'Military Personnel')\nMilitary Personnel\nDuty and tax do not apply for shipments of military personnel of the U.S. Armed Forces into Germany with a Form AE 550-175A. However, according to legislation, a courier company (UPS) may not represent the consignee at Customs using Form 550 175A, only the consignee or a representative of the US Forces can enter the customs declaration at the customs office at Cologne Airport. The only exception exists for shipments sent because of relocation of an Army member. Alternately UPS can enter customs declaration for military personnel into free circulation if consignee agrees to pay duty and taxes. In this case consignee must then provide UPS with a written authorization (POA). The customs declaration must be made within 20 days after the shipment arrives in Germany. UPS automatically returns the shipment after 19 days at shipper's expense if the declaration is not made before the expiration of this deadline.\nFor further information, see the internet link of the U.S. Army Headquarters in Europe:\nhttp://www.hqusareur.army.mil/opm/customs.htm\nReturned Goods\nGoods being returned to Germany can be re-imported without applying duty and tax under the following conditions: The goods have not been repaired or worked on while being in export country or territory; they have been in export country or territory no more than three years; the re-importer can prove the export with the initial export documents.\nVAT charges only apply if goods have been sold to a third party before being returned.\nThe invoice should state \"Return Goods\" and the reason for return. Customs inspection with re-import clearance is most likely. Import delay and accessorial charges will apply.\nRepaired Goods\nFor information please see 'Outward Processing Relief'.\nEmbassy or Diplomatic\nThe Embassy in Germany must provide a special Customs clearance form (form 0349) in original.\nWrite \"diplomatic goods\" on the invoice to expedite Customs clearance. A contact person and telephone number at the embassy should be stated on the invoice.\nCustoms does not charge duty or taxes for diplomatic shipments.\nAllow an additional 2 or 3 days for Customs clearance.\nGovernment (Non-Military)\nThe invoice should state \"Government Shipment\" for faster Customs clearance. Normally no duty or taxes apply to these types of shipments. Typical delay is 2-3 days.\nSolid Wood Packing Material\nNew requirements have been implemented for both small package and WWEF shipments and are based on the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 15, which is entitled \"Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade\". ISPM 15 was adopted internationally in 2002, and is gradually being introduced by countries or territories worldwide. Wood or wood products covered by ISPM 15 include items such as packing cases, boxes, crates, drums or similar packing, pallets, box pallets and other load boards, pallet collars and skids, but exclude such processed woods as orientated strand board, particle board, plywood or veneer, created using glue, heat and pressure or a combinations thereof, and, raw wood which is 6mm or less thick. It is recommended that if a question arises on this issue, please check with the authority that issues the Phytosanitary certificates in your country or territory.\nGovernment (Military)\nPlease refer to Military Shipments.\nWEEE and RoHS\nThe European Union implemented a directive restricting the use of certain hazardous substances in all Electronic & Electrical Equipment effective July 1, 2006. This directive is called the RoHS Directive (2005/618/EC), which stands for the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment.\nThe RoHS directive is closely linked with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) 2002/96/EC which sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for electrical goods.\nThese directives will ban the placing on the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) (PBB and PBDE are flame retardants used in some plastics).\nManufacturers (and distributors and individual sellers) will need to understand the requirements of the RoHS/WEEE Directives to ensure that their products, and their components, comply. Goods falling under these categories do not require any accompanying documentation for importation.\nFor more information on the EU directives, please check the following European Union web link or contact your local chamber of commerce:    http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/faq_weee.pdf\nOutward Processing (after repair)\nOutward Processing Relief (Goods re-imported after repair)\nIn order to qualify for any exemption from duties and taxes when re-importing repaired goods, the initial export declaration must have been the outward processing procedure. The initial export documentation needs to be available for the re-import declaration. Without these preconditions only declaration into free circulation is possible, duty and VAT will be payable on the value of the goods in addition to any repair costs.\nProvided the correct initial export documentation is available no duty or VAT applies for a warranty repair when re-importing. When charges occur to the re-importer for the repair and / or repair parts / labor costs etc., duty and VAT will be raised on these charges only.\nThe invoice must clearly state \"return after repair\", the type of repair (warranty repair or charges for repair), also the value of the commodity before repair, as well as any charges to re-importer. Customs inspections with both export and re-import clearance are likely.\nImport delays and accessorial charges will apply.\nInward Processing (Repair & Return)\nInward Processing Relief (repair, processing and return)\nThe customs procedure of inward processing is used for goods which will be repaired inside the European Union and re-exported after repair. Under this import procedure the goods stay under customs control until re-exportation under customs control.\nThe importer is obliged to re-export the items during the determined period granted for repair within the import declaration for inward processing. If the deadline for re-export is exceeded duty and VAT become due. Customs inspections with both import and re-export clearance is most likely.\nCustoms will not permit this procedure if goods are exempt from duty according to the tariff code and the importer can deduct the import VAT as deductable input VAT at his finance department (Business).\nIf the goods are exempt from duty and the VAT can be deducted as input VAT (Business) the procedure of free circulation might be the more favorable procedure to the importer as no additional charges apply and the goods are not under customs control.\nTo apply the inward processing procedure the invoice must clearly state that goods are being imported for the purpose of repair or processing.\nAdditional charges apply.\nOther Shipment Types\nAmendment issued by the Indian Government with effect from 4th April 2020 prohibits diagnostic kits ITC HS Code 3822 for export from India.",
