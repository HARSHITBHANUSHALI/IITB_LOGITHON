        "Content": "Import License\nCustoms may require an import license for certain products from certain countries or territories, depending on the harmonized tariff code. The importer must obtain the import license from the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The requirement of an import license depends on the country or territory of origin of the goods, not the country or territory of export. For further detailed information it is highly recommended to contact your chamber of commerce.\nDeclaration of Conformity\nDeclaration of Conformity (CE marking)\nThe European Community require certain standards on product safety for certain types of goods. The range of products covered by the directives must comply with the applicable directives when it is placed on the community market for the first time or put into use. Placing on the market in the meaning of the directives is the action of making a product available for the first time, either for payment or free of charge. 'Putting into service' takes place at the moment of first use within the Community by the end user (for example, produced for own use of the importer).\nRange of products\nThe most important products are toys, in-vitro diagnostic medical devices, medical devices, machinery, low voltage equipment, safety devices (for example, helmets), exhaust systems and electromagnetic compatibility. For a full overview please see the EU website:\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2022:247:TOC\nResponsibilities\nManufacturers are defined as the persons responsible for designing and manufacturing products supposed to be placed on the EU market. The manufacturer has an obligation to ensure that a product intended to be placed on the Community market is designed and manufactured, and it's conformity assessed, to the essential requirements in accordance with the provisions of the directives. The manufacturer may appoint any natural or legal person, established in the European Union, to act on his behalf as an authorized representative.\nThe authorized representative may be addressed by the authorities of the member states in regard to the manufacturer's obligations.\nThe importer is defined as any legal or natural person responsible for placing products on the EU market. He is responsible to provide the market surveillance authority with the necessary information about the safety of the product and a copy of the Declaration of Conformity (DoC). If the manufacturer is established in the EU or has a so called authorised representative it is his obligation to provide the necessary information.\nConformity Assessment Procedure\nGoods subject to the regulations on product safety need to be tested according to the rules applying for each group of products. Manufacturers have to draw up an EC declaration of conformity which is the first step of the conformity assessment procedure. The declaration of conformity has to include technical information containing the way of testing and the steps to be taken to obtain the attestation of conformity. The way of testing and steps to be taken depends on the type of product. If the testing was successful the producer is allowed to apply the so called 'CE sign' on the product or where this is not applicable (for example, surgical instruments) at the retail package or on a \"Declaration of Conformity\" certificate. The \"Declaration of Conformity\" has to be issued by a notified body certified by a member state of the European Union.\nNotified Body\nA notified body is an organization certified by the national government to carry out the tasks of the conformity assessment procedures. They can offer their service to any economic operator inside and outside the European Community. They can carry out the tests or monitor the tests carried out by the manufacturer. They can carry out these activities inside the EU or on the territory of third countries or territories.\nInformation about notified bodies and notified bodies itself can be found on the EU website:\nhttps://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/compliance/conformity-assessment/index_en.htm\nFor additional information, please also refer to \"Product Safety\".\nProduct Safety\nMarket Surveillance\nMarket Surveillance is organized and performed at national level. Each member state of the European Union (EU) is responsible for surveillance activities on its territory. Customs authorities are usually part of the market surveillance activities.\nOn customs request the \"Declaration of Conformity\" has to be provided by the shipper, the manufacturer or his assigned representative in the EU or the importer.\nDeclaration of Conformity\nThe Declaration of Conformity (DoC) is a document in which the manufacturer, or his authorized representative within the EU, indicates that the product meets all the necessary requirements of the directives applicable for the specific product. The DoC shall contain the name and the address of the manufacturer along with information about the product (for example, brand and serial number). The DoC must be signed by an individual working for the manufacturer or his authorized representative.\nOn request, the manufacturer or his authorized representative within the EU must provide the DoC. In case the manufacturer is not an EU entity and has no authorized representative, the importer must be able to provide a copy of the DoC and additional proofs if requested.\nNational Requirements\nFor some commodities, the conformity with the product safety regulations must be declared by the importer within the customs declaration. The DoC is required as a valid proof for the safety of the products and their compliance with the directives. These commodities are everything with CE marking like:\ntoys\nelectronic equipment\nradio & telecommunication equipment\nmedical devices\nsunglasses\nchemical substances\nmeasuring devices\npressure equipment\npyrotechnic articles\nSpot checks are carried out. If no CE marking is found and no DoC can be provided, the shipment is RTS'd or seized. Abandonment is also possible.\nCustoms procedure time is 2-3 months.\nFree Trade Agreements\nBilateral free trade agreements or unilateral autonomous preferential agreements allow the import clearance of certain products with a reduced duty rate or with a full duty exemption. The products benefiting from the preferential treatment must fulfil the necessary rules of originating in a country or territory covered by the preferential trade agreement.\nAn exporter who wants his products to benefit from the preferential treatment must be able to proof that his products fulfil the rules to be originating in a country or territory covered by the preferential trade agreement and they must provide a preferential document validated by the customs authorities or document with a valid preferential statement issued by themselves.\nThe preferential trade agreement foresees the following preferential proofs above.\nImport Control System 2 (ICS2)\nOn March 1, 2023, the European Union launched Release 2 of their Import Control System 2 (ICS2) for goods transported by air to EU (European Union) destinations plus Norway, Northern Ireland and Switzerland (regardless of origin).\nWhat is ICS2?\nThe Import Control System 2 (ICS2) is the second phase of electronic customs import system for the EU. This upgraded IT system is created to collect data about all goods entering the EU prior to their arrival. ICS2 aims to better protect Europes single market and its citizens with new customs safety and security measures and will facilitate free flow of trade through improved data-driven customs security processes that are adapted to global business models.\nICS2 is required for all shipments transiting via any EU country even if final destination is not a part of the EU, i.e. a shipment from Asia to the UK, where the goods are transiting via any EU country.\nImporters are required to provide a six-digit Harmonized System (HS) code for each commodity line listed in the commercial invoice and/or detailed goods descriptions for the shipments to avoid potential delays, fines or penalties and facilitate customs clearance. Where more than one HS code is present, the net weight of each is also required. The Economic Operators Registration and Identification Number (EORI) for the shipment recipient / consignee is also mandatory.\nWhen tendering a shipment to UPS Supply Chain Solutions destined to or via the EU, the following information is mandatory:\nShipper name, Shipper address, Recipient name, Recipient address, Number of packages, Gross weight, Acceptable goods description (see the full EU guidelines), Six-digit Harmonized System (HS) codes along with net weight of each where there is more than a single HS code involved. For EU-27, the recipients EORI number (see the full EU guidelines).\nIn a case where customers provide insufficient data to complete ICS2 data reporting requirements, UPS SCS will make a commercially reasonable effort to contact customers. If a shipper does not respond, the shipment would be held at the origin until all requirements are received.\nLetters, correspondence and other document shipments of no commercial value are excluded from this requirement. For more information on HS Codes, check out our Importers Guide to HTS Codes.\nFor more information on ICS2, please visit the European Commission website.\nCertificate of Origin\nA certificate of origin is not required for the import clearance of textiles.\nThe country or territory of origin must be stated on the invoice for each invoice line.

This also applies if only the individual Member State is noted in a previous proof of origin. The additional indication of a Member State, e.g. as \"EU/Germany\", is tolerated.\nForm A\nA Form A is only valid for imports from countries or territories covered by the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The products must fulfill the rules of be originating in the export country or territory Most products can be imported at a lower duty rate while others are fully exempted from duty.

Tissue from animals are taken (e.g. blood) and infected with certain substances or pathogens. The blood cells react with the production of antibodies which are than harvested and used for the production of the test kits. Due to the in vitro production and the controlled way of production those types of test kits are not subject to veterinarian control if it is a commercial production.\nPolyclonal antibodies are gained from living animals like rabbits.

The initial export documentation needs to be available for the re-import declaration. Without these preconditions only declaration into free circulation is possible, duty and VAT will be payable on the value of the goods in addition to any repair costs.\nProvided the correct initial export documentation is available no duty or VAT applies for a warranty repair when re-importing.

Customs inspections with both export and re-import clearance is most likely. The Outward Processing Relief has to be handled by the broker who raised the initial export declaration for outward processing.

Under this import procedure the goods stay under customs control until re-exportation under customs control.\nThe importer is obliged to re-export the items during the determined period granted for repair within the import declaration for inward processing. If the deadline for re-export is exceeded duty and VAT become due. Customs inspections with both import and re-export clearance is most likely.\nCustoms will not permit this procedure if goods are exempt from duty according to the tariff code and the importer can deduct the import VAT as deductable input VAT at his finance department.\nBusiness\nUPS does not offer the service of clearance under the Temporary Import Procedure. The goods have to be declared as definite import, duty and tax apply. Forwarding under bond to another customs broker assigned by the importer is possible. Additional charges apply.\nOther Shipment Types\nAmendment issued by the Indian Government with effect from 4th April 2020 prohibits diagnostic kits ITC HS Code 3822 for export from India.\nReturned Goods\nGoods being returned to France can be re-imported without applying duty and tax under the following conditions: The goods have not been repaired or worked on while being in export country or territory; they have been in export country or territory no more than three years; the re-importer can proof the export with the initial export documents. The reason for the return should be stated on the invoice (for example, refused by consignee or not conform to the goods ordered etc.)\nCustoms requires an invoice for each shipment of returned goods. French Customs must be alerted of the shipment in advance to import the shipment free of duty and taxes.\nUPS France must contact the consignee for proof of export, complete the documentation, and alert French Customs. Duty and taxes apply if this procedure is not completed before importation. Import delays may occur and accessorial charges may apply.\nRepaired Goods\nIf the repaired goods arrive at the UPS ports of entry and were not temporarily exported by an alternate broker,then the goods must be cleared as normal imports with duty & VAT payment on the total invoice value (value of the goods + repair costs).\nTemporary Import\nAll products, all service levels: no temporary import/export service in France."
