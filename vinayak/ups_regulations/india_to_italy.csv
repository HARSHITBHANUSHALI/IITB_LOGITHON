Product Safety
Market Surveillance
Market Surveillance is organized and performed at national level. Each member state of the EU (European Union) is responsible for surveillance activities on its territory. Customs authorities are usually part of the market surveillance activities.
On customs request the ""Declaration of Conformity"" has to be provided by the shipper, the manufacturer or his assigned representative in the EU or the importer.
Declaration of Conformity
The Declaration of Conformity (DoC) is a document in which the manufacturer, or his authorized representative within the EU, indicates that the product meets all the necessary requirements of the directives applicable for the specific product. The DoC shall contain the name and the address of the manufacturer along with information about the product (for example, brand and serial number). The DoC must be signed by an individual working for the manufacturer or his authorized representative.
On request the manufacturer or his authorized representative within the EU must provide the DoC. In case the manufacturer is not an EU entity and has no authorized representative the importer must be able to provide a copy of the DoC and additional proofs if requested.
National Requirements
For some commodities the conformity with the product safety regulations must be declared by the importer within the customs declaration. The DoC is required as a valid proof for the safety of the products and their compliance with the directives.
These commodities are everything (no exceptions) with CE marking, like:
toys
electronic equipment
radio & telecommunication equipment
medical devices
sunglasses
chemical substances
measuring devices
pressure equipment
pyrotechnic articles
Spot checks are carried out. If no CE marking is found, the goods can not be imported and therefore are seized by customs.
Free Trade Agreements
Bilateral free trade agreements or unilateral autonomous preferential agreements allow the import clearance of certain products with a reduced duty rate or with a full duty exemption. The products benefiting from the preferential treatment must fulfil the necessary rules of originating in a country or territory covered by the preferential trade agreement.
An exporter who wants his products to benefit from the preferential treatment must be able to proof that his products fulfil the rules to be originating in a country or territory covered by the preferential trade agreement and they must provide a preferential document validated by the customs authorities or document with a valid preferential statement issued by themselves.
The preferential trade agreement foresees the following preferential proofs above.
Import Control System 2 (ICS2)
On March 1, 2023, the European Union launched Release 2 of their Import Control System 2 (ICS2) for goods transported by air to EU (European Union) destinations plus Norway, Northern Ireland and Switzerland (regardless of origin).
What is ICS2?
The Import Control System 2 (ICS2) is the second phase of electronic customs import system for the EU. This upgraded IT system is created to collect data about all goods entering the EU prior to their arrival. ICS2 aims to better protect Europes single market and its citizens with new customs safety and security measures and will facilitate free flow of trade through improved data-driven customs security processes that are adapted to global business models.
ICS2 is required for all shipments transiting via any EU country even if final destination is not a part of the EU, i.e. a shipment from Asia to the UK, where the goods are transiting via any EU country.
Importers are required to provide a six-digit Harmonized System (HS) code for each commodity line listed in the commercial invoice and/or detailed goods descriptions for the shipments to avoid potential delays, fines or penalties and facilitate customs clearance. Where more than one HS code is present, the net weight of each is also required. The Economic Operators Registration and Identification Number (EORI) for the shipment recipient / consignee is also mandatory.
When tendering a shipment to UPS Supply Chain Solutions destined to or via the EU, the following information is mandatory:
Shipper name, Shipper address, Recipient name, Recipient address, Number of packages, Gross weight, Acceptable goods description (see the full EU guidelines), Six-digit Harmonized System (HS) codes along with net weight of each where there is more than a single HS code involved. For EU-27, the recipients EORI number (see the full EU guidelines).
In a case where customers provide insufficient data to complete ICS2 data reporting requirements, UPS SCS will make a commercially reasonable effort to contact customers. If a shipper does not respond, the shipment would be held at the origin until all requirements are received.
Letters, correspondence and other document shipments of no commercial value are excluded from this requirement. For more information on HS Codes, check out our Importers Guide to HTS Codes.
For more information on ICS2, please visit the European Commission website.

The range of products covered by the directives must comply with the applicable directives when it is placed on the community market for the first time or put into use. Placing on the market in the meaning of the directives is the action of making a product available for the first time, either for payment or free of charge. 'Putting into service' takes place at the moment of first use within the Community by the end user (for example, produced for own use of the importer).
Range of products
The most important products are toys, in-vitro diagnostic medical devices, medical devices, machinery, low voltage equipment, safety devices (for example, helmets), exhaust systems and electromagnetic compatibility.For a full overview please see the EU website:
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2022:247:TOC
Responsibilities
Manufacturers are defined as the persons responsible for designing and manufacturing products supposed to be placed on the EU market. The manufacturer has an obligation to ensure that a product intended to be placed on the Community market is designed and manufactured, and it's conformity assessed, to the essential requirements in accordance with the provisions of the directives. The manufacturer may appoint any natural or legal person, established in the European Union, to act on his behalf as an authorized representative.
The authorized representative may be addressed by the authorities of the member states in regard to the manufacturer's obligations.
The importer is defined as any legal or natural person responsible for placing products on the EU market. He is responsible to provide the market surveillance authority with the necessary information about the safety of the product and a copy of the Declaration of Conformity (DoC). If the manufacturer is established in the EU or has a so called authorized representative it is his obligation to provide the necessary information.
Conformity Assessment Procedure
Goods subject to the regulations on product safety need to be tested according to the rules applying for each group of products. Manufacturers have to draw up an EC declaration of conformity which is the first step of the conformity assessment procedure. The declaration of conformity has to include technical information containing the way of testing and the steps to be taken to obtain the attestation of conformity. The way of testing and steps to be taken depends on the type of product. If the testing was successful the producer is allowed to apply the so called 'CE sign' on the product or where this is not applicable (for example, surgical instruments) at the retail package or on a ""Declaration of Conformity"" certificate.
The ""Declaration of Conformity"" has to be issued by a notified body certified by a member state of the European Union.
Notified Body
A notified body is an organization certified by the national government to carry out the tasks of the conformity assessment procedures. They can offer their service to any economic operator inside and outside the European Community. They can carry out the tests or monitor the tests carried out by the manufacturer. They can carry out these activities inside the EU or on the territory of third countries or territories.
Information about notified bodies and notified bodies itself can be found on the EU website:

Special Clearance Requirements,"Temporary Import
Within the customs procedure of temporary importation, goods designated to be imported for a limited stretch of time and remaining in the same state can be cleared without duty and VAT. The imported goods are often intended for exhibition purposes, testing purposes or presenting to potential customers. The goods remain under customs control until the re-export.
Goods imported with the customs procedure of temporary importation are subject to the provision of security with limited exemptions. The security covers duty and taxes and will be calculated on the base of the customs value used for a declaration for free circulation. The security has to be paid on deposit by the importer prior to release. The security will be paid back by customs when re-exporting the goods under customs control.
The invoice must clearly state that the goods are being temporarily imported but not for processing or repair. It will be also useful to put the reason of import on the invoice. Customs inspections might be possible.
In order for the importer to reclaim the security goods, the shipment must be re-exported under the temporarily import / export procedure.
We highly recommend to check, before shipping, with the local destination Brokerage department, if this service can be provided (in most cases when a security has to be provided, UPS does not) and if the additional costs applicable will be in line with the value of shipment or if the costs will be even higher than paying duties and taxes. Taxes can be reclaimed from businesses.
If service cannot be provided through UPS, the consignee has to name an alternate broker for the customs procedure of temporary importation.
For a temporary import, it is recommended to evaluate the charges that will apply.The additional charges for a temporary import procedure may be higher than the duty and VAT amount rate for a ""normal"" import.Additional charges for the temporary import procedure that will incur:
 Movement under NCTS customs bond, Temporary import formal entry, Guarantee payment of duty and tax and Alternate broker fees
Furthermore several additional days in time in transit will occur.

Returned Goods
The import of goods exported within the last two years can be done without duty. The items must be in the same state like they were at the time of export.
The original export declaration is required. A customs inspection is most likely. Delays and additional charges may apply.

WEEE and RoHS
The European Union implemented a directive restricting the use of certain hazardous substances in all Electronic & Electrical Equipment effective July 1, 2006. This directive is called the RoHS Directive (2005/618/EC), which stands for the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment.
The RoHS directive is closely linked with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) 2002/96/EC which sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for electrical goods.
These directives will ban the placing on the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) (PBB and PBDE are flame retardants used in some plastics).
Manufacturers (and distributors and individual sellers) will need to understand the requirements of the RoHS/WEEE Directives to ensure that their products, and their components, comply. Goods falling under these categories do not require any accompanying documentation for importation.

The initial export declaration must have been correctly processed to indicate that the goods were exported for repair. If the export documentation is either incorrect or not available, duties and / or VAT will be payable on the value of the goods and any repair costs.

Inward Procesing (Repair & Return)
Inward Processing Relief (repair, processing and return)
The customs procedure of inward processing is used for goods who are supposed to be repaired or processed inside the European Union and re-exported after repair or processing. The import procedure correct re-export of the goods. A provision of security to cover duty and VAT is most likely. The importer is obliged to re-export the items during the period granted for repair within the import declaration for inward processing. If the re-export fails within this given period duty and VAT become due. Customs inspections with the import and re-export clearance is possible.
UPS does not offer the service of clearance under the Inward Processing Relief Procedure. Commodities subject to be imported temporarily for repair or processing purposes have to be declared within a regular import declaration. Duty and VAT applies.
