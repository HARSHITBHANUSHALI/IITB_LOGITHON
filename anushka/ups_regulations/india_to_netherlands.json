For further detailed information it is highly recommended to contact your chamber of commerce.\nDeclaration of Conformity\nDeclaration of Conformity (CE marking)\nThe European Community require certain standards on product safety for certain types of goods. The range of products covered by the directives must comply with the applicable directives when it is placed on the community market for the first time or put into use. Placing on the market in the meaning of the directives is the action of making a product available for the first time, either for payment or free of charge. 'Putting into service' takes place at the moment of first use within the Community by the end user (for example, produced for own use of the importer).\nRange of products\nThe most important products are toys, in-vitro diagnostic medical devices, medical devices, machinery, low voltage equipment, safety devices (for example, helmets), exhaust systems and electromagnetic compatibility.For a full overview please see the EU website:\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2022:247:TOC\nResponsibilities\nManufacturers are defined as the persons responsible for designing and manufacturing products supposed to be placed on the EU market. The manufacturer has an obligation to ensure that a product intended to be placed on the Community market is designed and manufactured, and it's conformity assessed, to the essential requirements in accordance with the provisions of the directives. The manufacturer may appoint any natural or legal person, established in the European Union, to act on his behalf as an authorized representative.\nThe authorized representative may be addressed by the authorities of the member states in regard to the manufacturer's obligations.\nThe importer is defined as any legal or natural person responsible for placing products on the EU market. He is responsible to provide the market surveillance authority with the necessary information about the safety of the product and a copy of the Declaration of Conformity (DoC). If the manufacturer is established in the EU or has a so called authorized representative it is his obligation to provide the necessary information.\nConformity Assessment Procedure\nGoods subject to the regulations on product safety need to be tested according to the rules applying for each group of products. Manufacturers have to draw up an EC declaration of conformity which is the first step of the conformity assessment procedure. The declaration of conformity has to include technical information containing the way of testing and the steps to be taken to obtain the attestation of conformity. The way of testing and steps to be taken depends on the type of product. If the testing was successful the producer is allowed to apply the so called 'CE sign' on the product or where this is not applicable (for example, surgical instruments) at the retail package or on a \"Declaration of Conformity\" certificate.\nThe \"Declaration of Conformity\" has to be issued by a notified body certified by a member state of the European Union.\nNotified Body\nA notified body is an organization certified by the national government to carry out the tasks of the conformity assessment procedures. They can offer their service to any economic operator inside and outside the European Community. They can carry out the tests or monitor the tests carried out by the manufacturer. They can carry out these activities inside the EU or on the territory of third countries or territories.\nInformation about notified bodies and notified bodies itself can be found on the EU website:\nhttps://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/compliance/conformity-assessment/index_en.htm\nFor additional information, please also refer to \"Product Safety\".\nFree Trade Agreements\nBilateral free trade agreements or unilateral autonomous preferential agreements allow the import clearance of certain products with a reduced duty rate or with a full duty exemption. The products benefiting from the preferential treatment must fulfil the necessary rules of originating in a country or territory covered by the preferential trade agreement.\nAn exporter who wants his products to benefit from the preferential treatment must be able to proof that his products fulfil the rules to be originating in a country or territory covered by the preferential trade agreement and they must provide a preferential document validated by the customs authorities or document with a valid preferential statement issued by themselves.\nThe preferential trade agreement foresees the following preferential proofs above.\nImport Control System 2 (ICS2)\nOn March 1, 2023, the European Union launched Release 2 of their Import Control System 2 (ICS2) for goods transported by air to EU (European Union) destinations plus Norway, Northern Ireland and Switzerland (regardless of origin).\nWhat is ICS2?\nThe Import Control System 2 (ICS2) is the second phase of electronic customs import system for the EU. This upgraded IT system is created to collect data about all goods entering the EU prior to their arrival. ICS2 aims to better protect Europes single market and its citizens with new customs safety and security measures and will facilitate free flow of trade through improved data-driven customs security processes that are adapted to global business models.\nICS2 is required for all shipments transiting via any EU country even if final destination is not a part of the EU, i.e. a shipment from Asia to the UK, where the goods are transiting via any EU country.\nImporters are required to provide a six-digit Harmonized System (HS) code for each commodity line listed in the commercial invoice and/or detailed goods descriptions for the shipments to avoid potential delays, fines or penalties and facilitate customs clearance. Where more than one HS code is present, the net weight of each is also required. The Economic Operators Registration and Identification Number (EORI) for the shipment recipient / consignee is also mandatory.\nWhen tendering a shipment to UPS Supply Chain Solutions destined to or via the EU, the following information is mandatory:\nShipper name, Shipper address, Recipient name, Recipient address, Number of packages, Gross weight, Acceptable goods description (see the full EU guidelines), Six-digit Harmonized System (HS) codes along with net weight of each where there is more than a single HS code involved. For EU-27, the recipients EORI number (see the full EU guidelines).\nIn a case where customers provide insufficient data to complete ICS2 data reporting requirements, UPS SCS will make a commercially reasonable effort to contact customers. If a shipper does not respond, the shipment would be held at the origin until all requirements are received.\nLetters, correspondence and other document shipments of no commercial value are excluded from this requirement. For more information on HS Codes, check out our Importers Guide to HTS Codes.\nFor more information on ICS2, please visit the European Commission website\nCertificate of Origin\nA certificate of origin is not required for the import clearance of textiles.\nThe country or territory of origin must be stated on the invoice for each invoice line. If the customs authorities doubt the correctness of the declared country or territory of origin they may request an additional proof which might be a certificate of origin.\nCertificate of Origin must meet the following customs stipulations:\nMust be an original form\nMust be issued and originally signed by the Chamber of Commerce\nMust contain a seal or watermark in the paper\nMust provide a detailed description of the goods. General descriptions of goods, such as clothes or garments will not be accepted.\nBox 4 \"Country of origin\" / Box 5 \"Country of destination\"\nIf the goods originate in the European Community or if the country of destination is in the European Community, care must be taken to indicate the European Community and not the individual Member State in heading 4 or 5. This also applies if only the individual Member State is noted in a previous proof of origin. The additional indication of a Member State, e.g. as \"EU/Germany\", is tolerated.\nMSDS-NON DG\nGoods under IATA Special Provisions A67 require a MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet).\nIt is not required for all, however shipments can be held by local authority in United Arab Emirates after screening due to lack of MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) or NON DG (Dangerous Goods) declaration letter from the shipper resulting to misconnections and impacting end-to-end service.\nIt would be advisable for all shipments originating, transiting and terminating for UAE to have MSDS or NON DG declaration from shipper enclosed in the shipment and copies to be uploaded in IDIS.\nProduct Safety\nMarket Surveillance\nMarket Surveillance is organized and performed at national level. Each member state of the EU (European Union) is responsible for surveillance activities on its territory. Customs authorities are usually part of the market surveillance activities.\nOn customs request the \"Declaration of Conformity\" has to be provided by the shipper, the manufacturer or his assigned representative in the EU or the importer.\nDeclaration of Conformity\nThe Declaration of Conformity (DoC) is a document in which the manufacturer, or his authorized representative within the EU, indicates that the product meets all the necessary requirements of the directives applicable for the specific product. The DoC shall contain the name and the address of the manufacturer along with information about the product (for example, brand and serial number). The DoC must be signed by an individual working for the manufacturer or his authorized representative.\nOn request the manufacturer or his authorized representative within the EU must provide the DoC. In case the manufacturer is not an EU entity and has no authorized representative the importer must be able to provide a copy of the DoC and additional proofs if requested.\nNational Requirements\nFor some commodities the conformity with the product safety regulations must be declared by the importer within the customs declaration. The DoC is required as a valid proof for the safety of the products and their compliance with the directives.\nThese commodities are:\ntoys\nlasers\nSpot checks are carried out. If no CE marking is found and no other DoC can be provided, the shipments are seized and abandoned. Customs procedure time is 2-6 weeks.\nForm A\nA Form A is only valid for imports from countries or territories covered by the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The products must fulfill the rules of be originating in the export country or territory Most products can be imported at a lower duty rate while others are fully exempted from duty.

The antique status has to be confirmed by a registered expert of the export or import country or territory.\nMeat\nMeats are considered Animal Products. For more details please see \u001aAnimal Products\u001a.\nAnimal Products\nProducts Of Animal Origin are goods which contain at least partly material derived from the body of an animal. These products can be divided in food or non-food.\nFood means any substance, whether processed, semi-processed or raw, which is intended for human consumption, but does not include cosmetics or substances used only as pharmaceuticals.\nNon-Food (not intended for human consumption) includes animal by-products, animal feed, samples for testing or research purposes (food-grade or non-food grade), and in vitro diagnostics (IVD).\nAnimal products and animal by-products are often subject to a veterinary inspection. These products can only be accepted under a special contract for International Special Commodities (ISC). In addition those products must undergo veterinary checks at an approved Veterinary Border Inspection Post (BIP) when entering the EU & EFTA countries or territories (EU regulations are aligned for EU countries or territories and NO; IS; CH; LI).\nFor UPS shipments arriving in the EU by air, Cologne is the first point of arrival /BIP. Inspections will be processed at Cologne but final customs clearance process will be issued in the destination country or territory.\nAdditional charges for Vet-inspection will be applicable \u001a see Brokerage Services and Charges.\nImport requirements:\nGenerally, each type of Product of Animal Origin has specific import requirements that must be met. Food which is subject to veterinary inspections must:\nCome from an EU listed Third Country or Territory (no safeguard measures in place)\nCome from an EU approved establishment . Registered producers are listed under the following link: http://ec.europa.eu/food/international/trade/third_en.htm\nBe accompanied by appropriate Health Certificate(s), signed by a veterinarian of the competent authority of country or territory of export.

There are two types of antibodies, the monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies.\nMonoclonal antibodies are generated in vitro. Tissue from animals are taken (e.g. blood) and infected with certain substances or pathogens. The blood cells react with the production of antibodies which are than harvested and used for the production of the test kits. Due to the in vitro production and the controlled way of production those types of test kits are not subject to veterinarian control if it is a commercial production.\nPolyclonal antibodies are gained from living animals like rabbits. They are infected with the substances / pathogens and the animals are producing antibodies. The antibodies are harvested from the blood stream of the animals. Test reagents with polyclonal antibodies are subject to vet inspections.\nShipment documents (commercial invoice or declaration on letterhead) should include:\n\u001a the place of origin of the material\n\u001a the quantity of the material, in weight or volume\n\u001a a description of the material/ animal source\n\u001a catalogue number and price (if available)\n\u001a additives (e.g., sodium azide, glycerol), their source (e.g., whole serum, supernatant, ascites), and purification, if any.\n\u001a protocols \u001a the recommended protocol or datasheet indicating any unique fixation, detergent, blocking, or incubation conditions.\n\u001a the intended use (commercial/ manufacturing; research/ testing)\n\u001a the name and address of the shipper\n\u001a the name and address of the receiver\nCommercially packaged, ready-to-use In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) containing products of animal of origin, do not require a Vet-inspection, if compliant with Directive 98/79/EC on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices. A declaration of conformity (CE-marking) must be provided for each individual commodity (e.g. reagents, test kits, immunosorbent assays such as ELISA kits.\nTextiles\nA certificate of origin is not required for the import clearance of textiles. The need of a certificate of origin for the import clearance was reversed on October 24, 2011.\nThe country or territory of origin must be stated on the invoice for each invoice line. If the customs authorities doubt the correctness of the declared country or territory of origin they may request an additional proof which might be a certificate of origin.\nFood Supplements\nCustoms classifies food supplements as medicine if the ingredients are classified as medicine-therefore we cannot process the shipments without an ingredient list and these will be returned.\nIf Customs classifies certain food supplements as medicine they can not be imported by private individuals without an import license. Food supplements classified as medicine and shipped without an Import License will be destroyed by customs.\nFor more details please see 'medicine'.\nFish and Fish Products\nFish and fish products are considered Animal Products.

        "Content": "Temporary Import\nWithin the customs procedure of temporary importation, goods designated to be imported for a limited stretch of time and remaining in the same state can be cleared without duty and VAT. The imported goods are often intended for exhibition purposes, testing purposes or presenting to potential customers. The goods remain under customs control until the re-export.\nGoods imported with the customs procedure of temporary importation are subject to the provision of security with limited exemptions. The security covers duty and taxes and will be calculated on the base of the customs value used for a declaration for free circulation. The security has to be paid on deposit by the importer prior to release. The security will be paid back by customs when re-exporting the goods under customs control.\nThe invoice must clearly state that the goods are being temporarily imported but not for processing or repair. It will be also useful to put the reason of import on the invoice. Customs inspections might be possible.\nIn order for the importer to reclaim the security goods, the shipment must be re-exported under the temporarily import / export procedure.\nWe highly recommend to check, before shipping, with the local destination Brokerage department, if this service can be provided (in most cases when a security has to be provided, UPS does not) and if the additional costs applicable will be in line with the value of shipment or if the costs will be even higher than paying duties and taxes. Taxes can be reclaimed from businesses.\nIf service cannot be provided through UPS, the consignee has to name an alternate broker for the customs procedure of temporary importation.\nSamples\nThe invoice must give a detailed description of the sample(s) and indicate if the sample(s) are marked or mutilated. If the samples are not marked or mutilated so that they could be sold, then duty and tax will apply.\nEmbassy or Diplomatic\nShipments destined to embassies in the Netherlands may be exempt from tax and duty providing the embassy supplies UPS with a special form called \"libre permis\". Shipments will be on hold pending receipt from the receiving embassy.\nSolid Wood Packing Material\nNew requirements have been implemented for both small package and WWEF shipments and are based on the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 15, which is entitled \"Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade\". ISPM 15 was adopted internationally in 2002, and is gradually being introduced by countries or territories worldwide. Wood or wood products covered by ISPM 15 include items such as packing cases, boxes, crates, drums or similar packing, pallets, box pallets and other load boards, pallet collars and skids, but exclude such processed woods as orientated strand board, particle board, plywood or veneer, created using glue, heat and pressure or a combinations thereof, and, raw wood which is 6mm or less thick. It is recommended that if a question arises on this issue, please check with the authority that issues the Phytosanitary certificates in your country or territory.\nWEEE and RoHS\nThe European Union implemented a directive restricting the use of certain hazardous substances in all Electronic & Electrical Equipment effective July 1, 2006. This directive is called the RoHS Directive (2005/618/EC), which stands for the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment.\nThe RoHS directive is closely linked with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) 2002/96/EC which sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for electrical goods.\nThese directives will ban the placing on the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) (PBB and PBDE are flame retardants used in some plastics).\nManufacturers (and distributors and individual sellers) will need to understand the requirements of the RoHS/WEEE Directives to ensure that their products, and their components, comply. Goods falling under these categories do not require any accompanying documentation for importation.\nFor more information on the EU directives, please check the following European Union web link or contact your local chamber of commerce: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/faq_weee.pdf\nOutward Processing (after repair)\nOutward Processing Relief (Goods re-imported after repair)\nIn order to qualify for any exemption from duties and taxes, certain documentation relating to the initial export of the goods must be submitted with the import entry. The initial export entry must have been correctly processed to indicate that the goods were exported for repair. If the export documentation is either incorrect or not available, duties and / or VAT will be payable on the value of the goods and any repair costs.\nDuty and tax may apply on repair costs and added value. The invoice must declare the value of the commodity before repair, as well as the value of the repair and clearly state that it is a re-importation.\nImport delay and accessorial charges will apply.\nInward Processing (Repair & Return)\nInward Processing Relief: The customs procedure of inward processing is used for goods who are supposed to be repaired inside the European Union and re-exported after repair. The import procedure requires customs control till the correct re-export of the goods.\nThe importer is obliged to re-export the items during the period granted for repair within the import declaration for inward processing. A provision of security to cover duty and VAT is most likely.\nIf the re-export fails within this given period duty and VAT becomes due. Customs inspections with the import and re-export clearance is most likely.\nThe invoice must clearly state that goods are being imported for the purpose of repair or processing. A customs inspection is mandatory. Additional costs apply.\nThe service of Inward Processing Relief is offered on contract base only.\nOther Shipment Types\nAmendment issued by the Indian Government with effect from 4th April 2020 prohibits diagnostic kits ITC HS Code 3822 for export from India.\nMilitary Shipments\nThe invoice should clearly describe the type of transaction (commercial or non-commercial transaction). The goods may be exempt from duty and tax providing the military base supplies UPS with a special form called \"302\". Shipments will be on hold depending on receipt of the form from the receiving military base.",
