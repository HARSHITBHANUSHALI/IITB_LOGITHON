Please do not open global cases before 3 business days, if need you are able to open just after this deadline. This is just an estimated time not guaranteed because it is a government intervene, out of UPS control and so UPS cannot expedite or avoid this SEFAZ retention.

It is important to know that all the north and northeast are considered extended areas.

General descriptions like codes, samples, gifts, will not be accepted and the consignee will be penalized with fines.
The system will also concentrate TAX ID validating thru a customs data base of every consignee. If the consignee has any restrictions to import goods, the shipment will be returned to overgoods. To minimize import holds into Brazil, shipments with import restrictions or missing TAX ID's will be returned to overgoods in 10 days.

Brazil Customs has recently introduced very strict controls on the importation of non-documents. They are particularly concentrating on ensuring that goods shipped to private individuals and companies have proper descriptions and values provided on the commercial invoice.
