Import Documentation,"Steel License
A steel licensing system has been instituted to facilitate the monitoring of certain steel imports. Under the ""reasonable care"" guidelines, it is the responsibility of the Importer or the Importer's Broker to obtain a steel license on all entries for consumption of covered steel products.
You can apply for a license up to 60 days prior to the expected date of importation.
For more information, contact the Import Administration or see http://www.ia.ita.doc.gov/steel/license
The filer must print the license at the time of filing. The Department of Commerce will e-mail confirmation of the application and license number.
The fee for an application or an Import License is US$21.75.
The license is valid for 75 days and cannot be reused.
A single license can only be presented with one Entry Summary (CBP 7501) and may cover multiple products if the Importer/Exporter, Manufacturer, and Country or Territory of Origin remain the same. A separate license will be required if the information differs.
The one exception to the Steel License and Surge Monitoring Program will be ""informal"" entries. Informal entries are shipments valued at between US$200.00 and US$2,500.00.
For licensing purposes, an informal entry is defined as:
A value not exceeding US$2,500.00 when using a Chapter 72 or 73 HTSUS#
Note: Informal entries included in a formal entry will require a license.
Consumer Prod SafetyImprovement Act
New import requirements for consumer goods took effect on November 12, 2008.
Beginning on that date importers must certify in writing that products being imported for warehousing and/or consumption conform to the rules, bans, regulations or standards administered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).
The new requirements apply to nearly all categories of consumer goods, including:
fabrics
wearing apparel
toys
jewelry
sporting goods
furniture
hazardous material
all-terrain vehicles
even pharmaceuticals subject to child-resistant cap standards
The new certificate of conformity guidelines:
Only the importer must issue the certificate.
Foreign manufacturers and private labelers of imported products do not need to issue certificates, and they do not need to be listed as parties on certificates. For products manufactured in the United States, only the domestic manufacturer needs to issue the certificate.
The certificate, in hard copy or electronic form, must be available to the CPSC no later than the time the shipment is available for inspection in the U.S.
The certificate must contain the following information:
Identification of the product covered by the certificate;
Citation to each CPSC regulation to which the product is being certified;
Identification of the importer (or domestic manufacturer, as applicable) certifying compliance (including name of company, full mailing address, and phone number).
Contact information for individual maintaining the test results, including the persons name, email address, full mailing address, and phone number.
Date (at least month and year) and place (including city and country or territory or administrative region) where the product was manufactured. If the same manufacturer operates more than one location in the same city, the street address of the factory in question should be provided.
Date and place (including city and country or territory or administrative region) where the product was tested for compliance with the cited regulation.
Identification of any third-party lab on whose testing the certification depends, including name, full mailing address and phone number.
CPSC recommends that each issuer maintain test records supporting the certification for at least three years.
Power of Attorney
Power of Attorney (POA) is obtained to transfer the liability for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) compliance to the importer. If the POA has been properly executed, the importer is responsible for default of further obligations to CBP.
It is essential that the following guidelines be followed in order to limit the potential liability of UPS SCS when it otherwise may qualify as an Importer of Record (IOR) for all service levels associated with the small package operations.
These guidelines are not intended to cover all possible scenarios that might require UPS SCS to obtain a POA from a customer. Some examples that might change the decision as to whether to obtain a POA include:
When customer is the subject of a CBP penalty or another government agency investigation
If UPS SCS has been penalized by CBP or another government agency for inaccurate information furnished by customer
When customers credit history is poor
When the customers shipment values fluctuate without adequate explanation
POA Requirements for all service levels
POA is required from the customer when the entered value of a single shipment exceeds $50,000 USD.
In the following cases a POA is required regardless of shipments entered values:
All Temporary Import Bonds (TIB)
Any shipment that is similar to a shipment that Customs has found not to be legally marked under the country or territory of origin marking laws (i.e. Not Legally Marked (NLMs)).
Shipments requiring a conditional release from Participating Government Agencies (PGA) such as Food & Drug Administration and Fish & Wildlife Service
Formal commercial shipments containing finished tobacco products, alcoholic beverages
Products subject to antidumping or countervailing duty orders
Shipments subject to the Lacey Act where UPS files the declaration
Shipments subject to Free Trade Agreements containing textiles
Import Declaration
Any shipment that is a U.S. good returning and has a value over US$10,000.00 requires the presentation of a Manufacturer's Affidavit to Customs.
MSDS-NON DG
Goods under IATA Special Provisions A67 require a MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet).
It is not required for all, however shipments can be held by local authority in United Arab Emirates after screening due to lack of MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) or NON DG (Dangerous Goods) declaration letter from the shipper resulting to misconnections and impacting end-to-end service.
It would be advisable for all shipments originating, transiting and terminating for UAE to have MSDS or NON DG declaration from shipper enclosed in the shipment and copies to be uploaded in IDIS."
Clearance Information,"Post Office Boxes
UPS cannot deliver to a P.O. Box address. All packages require a consignee's contact name and complete street address including apartment, suite or unit number if applicable. The consignee's telephone number should be provided if known.
Imports from Iran
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) prohibits the direct or indirect importation into the U.S. any article that is the product of Islamic Republic of Iran.
U.S. persons and companies that currently import food and carpets from Iran should be aware of the guidance issued July 1, 2010, by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) concerning a change in U.S. law made by the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (""CISADA"").
OFAC's Iranian Transactions Regulations currently contain a general license authorizing the importation into the U.S. of foodstuffs from Iran that are classified under chapters 2-23 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) (such as pistachios and non-beluga caviar (which is prohibited by other aspects of law). In addition, the importation of carpets and other textile floor coverings of Iranian origin that are classified under chapter 57 or heading 9706.00.0060 of the HTS are also authorized.
However, due to the additional Iran sanctions recently passed by Congress, OFAC will soon issue a regulation amending the Iranian Transaction Regulations to eliminate the general license and such imports will be no longer permitted starting on September 29, 2010. OFAC has also indicated that any authorized Iranian products must be imported by September 28, 2010 and it will not issue any specific licenses authorizing any imports after that date. As a result, importers must move quickly to ensure that any pending orders are entered for consumption by their customs brokers by September 28, 2010.
Restricted Articles
U.S. Customs & Border Protection enforces laws relating to the protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). Included in the IPR are trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and patents. Examples of products for import that would qualify under the IPR restrictions are: NFL, NBA, NCAA, MLB jerseys, shirts, caps, memorabilia, or any products with the registered trade name of Coca Cola, Disney, Rolex, Nike, etc. Such products may be refused entry into the U.S. if Customs believes the goods are counterfeit or for resale in the U.S. without approval from the IPR owner. Any article(s) found to infringe upon the registered trademarks; trade names, copyrights or patents will be subject to immediate seizure and forfeiture.

This occurs when, after prescribed time limits expire, goods remain unentered into the commerce of the U.S. After time limits expire, goods may be moved into a general order storage facility under Customs custody.
Critical Time Limits
15 calendar days from the date of arrival imported goods are deemed G.O. eligible by CBP. UPS Operations/Carrier will notify CBP on the 15th calendar day after the date of arrival of any shipment that has not been presented for entry. CBP will then make the determination to move the freight to the G.O. warehouse.
G.O. goods stay in CBP custody in a bonded warehouse for six months from the date of arrival before they are considered unclaimed or abandoned. At that time, CBP may auction the product to recover expenses associated with the G.O.
Withdrawing Goods from a G.O. Warehouse
Importers have six months from the date of importation to export general order merchandise. Storage and handling fees apply.
Importers may also enter the goods under a consumption entry or any other type entry. Storage and other fees including applicable fines, taxes, and duties apply.

UPS Special Handling charge: US$25.00 per shipment.
Please be aware, the Fish and Wildlife Service prohibits the importation of certain animals and animal products. This list includes but is not limited to: Sea turtles, Ivory, Furs (wild cats, seals, sea otter, etc.), Birds, Primates, Reptiles and reptilian leathers. Each of these items has its own exceptions, please visit www.fws.gov for more information. Tuesday, May 28, 2013 The Fish and Wildlife Service announced May 22 that until further notice it will prohibit the following with respect to trade in protected species of wild animals and plants. - Commercial import or introduction from the sea from, and the commercial export or reexport to, Guinea of specimens listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora - All imports and introduction from the sea from, and all exports or reexports to, Afghanistan, Djibouti and Lesotho of CITES-listed specimens The FWS states that all such prohibited shipments or specimens are subject to refusal of import/export or seizure and forfeiture. These prohibitions are being imposed because the countries or territories listed have failed to implement the required CITES legislation or file the required annual reports on their implementation of CITES. The U.S. therefore cannot establish the legal origin of wildlife that is exported or reexported from these countries or territories and also cannot allow trade to these countries or territories since the necessary enforcement provisions are not in place to ensure the CITES treaty is being implemented.
Dietary Supplements

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made some changes to its regulations on the submission of prior notice for imported food. Changes to the prior notice regulations:
Removes the requirement that the identity of the anticipated border crossing within the port of arrival be provided in the prior notice
Removes the requirement to provide the 6 digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule number in the prior notice
Requires the registration number of the manufacturer (or the full address of the manufacturer and a reason) in all circumstances
The final rule will require the PN (prior notice) to include the name and full address of the shipper, if the shipper is different from the manufacturer (in order to eliminate duplicative requirements)
Identity of the manufacturer, for food no longer in its natural state (for commercial shipments):
The final rule will revise the PN information requirements in 21 CFR 1.281(a)(6) for an article of food that is no longer in its natural state, to require the name of the manufacturer and either:
The registration number, city and country or territory of the manufacturer or
Both the full address of the manufacturer and the reason the registration number is not provided
Identity of manufacturer if such food sent as a personal gift:
The final rule will revise the PN information requirements for an article of food that is no longer in its natural state to remove the current option that allows the name and address that appears on the label under 21 CFR 101.5 to be submitted instead of the name, address, and registration number of the manufacturer for food sent by an individual as a personal gift (i.e., for non-business reasons) to an individual in the U.S. Prior Notice is not required for home-made non-commercial food shipments shipped by an individual, to an individual, as gifts for personal use. Furthermore, current FDA policy is not to require Prior Notice when food purchased at a commercial establishment is exported or offered for export by a non-commercial shipper for a non-commercial purpose (i.e., from an individual, to an individual, as a gift or as a household good for personal use). Additional exclusion criteria can be found at the FDA web site.

Textiles
Customs and Border Protection has recently issued an administrative message TBT-09-007 ""Amendment to Formal Entry Requirements for Textiles"".
As a result, current procedures for textile entries will change according to the following guidelines:
Textiles valued at $200.49 or less should be processed as a Section 321.
Textiles valued between $200.50 and $250.49 should be processed as Informal.
Textiles valued over $250.49 should be submitted as Formal.
With the elimination of the visa arrangements, the provision that allows for properly marked commercial samples no longer applies. Samples entering the United States must now meet the mutilated samples guidelines as described in HTS chapter 98 under subheading 9811.00.60.
A few limited entry type exceptions, for example imports for U.S. Government Agencies, all U.S. Import entries value over $2500.49 USD require the Importer of Record to have Customs Bond. So, a presumption must be made that all private entities acting as importer of record must have a bond. The bond is the financial guarantee payable to U.S. Customs as sole beneficiary that import entry will be made, completed, lawful duties, and fees paid, and compliance with all applicable U.S. laws.
For textiles to the U.S. if FTA is not claimed then UPS may be importer of record, up to $50,000.49 USD. Therefore, the consignee is not required to give UPS POA. Subsequently, they are not required to secure bond in there name. UPS assumes liability as importer of record and UPS's bond guarantees the entry.
For textiles to the U.S. valued over $200.49 USD if FTA is claimed, except for NAFTA eligible shipments via certain modes of transport, then UPS may not be importer of record. UPS must secure the POA from the consignee, or other financially interested party, to make entry in their name. That party as importer of record must have a bond in their name. If a continuous bond is not already on file then UPS will execute single transaction bond in their name based on the POA's authority. A single transaction bond will carry a $4 premium charge per $1000 in surety coverage, rounded up, with a minimum of $40 USD. So a shipment bonded up to $10,000 USD will be covered by the $40.00 minimum.
CD Roms
A CD Rom and other portable storage media shipped commercially containing software, music, video or pictures are subject to duty and require a commercial invoice.
Pencils

Radio Frequency Devices
Anything that is electronic, battery-operated, or capable of sending, receiving, or interfering with radio signals may be considered a radio-frequency device. Examples of such devices include radio and TV receivers, converters, transmitters, transmitting devices, radio frequency amplifiers, microwave ovens, industrial heaters, ultrasonic transceivers, and computers.
Prior to July 1, 2016, importers were required to file FCC Form 740, Section 2.1203  General Requirement for Entry, and Section 2.1205  Filing of Required Declaration, along with their customs entry documentation.
As of July 1, 2016, the preceding requirement has been temporarily suspended, (see FCC-15-135A1). A proposal is being considered to permanently discontinue the requirement to file an FCC Form 740. (see (FCC 15-92).The suspension of FCC Form 740 only eliminates the requirement to file the form.
Importation of radio frequency equipment still requires that the product:
(1) Has the required FCC equipment authorization;
(2) Is only being imported for evaluation;
(3) Is only being imported for demonstration at a trade show; or
(4) Meets one of the conditions as permitted in Section 2.1204 (see Question 3 of the Equipment Authorization  Importation website).
For more information, see the Equipment Authorization - Importation website.
Gift Cards
Plastic Gift Cards 4911.99.8000 per Customs Ruling W968266
Textiles - Manufacturer's ID
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has eliminated the need for Textile Declaration for textile and wearing apparel goods into the U.S. Instead CBP has amended the reporting requirements for importers to identify the manufacturer of textile and apparel products through a manufacturer identification code (MID). The MID is a critical element of an importer's obligation to report information to CBP on customs entries. The MID is formulated by UPS Supply Chain Solutions using information provided by the U.S. importer. For textile and apparel products subject to the updated Declaration regulations, the importer will now be required to furnish sufficient information to meet the new MID requirements. These requirements are to provide the following:
Full name and address of the manufacturer performing the country or territory of origin conferring operations of each textile and apparel product.
When textile and apparel products from multiple manufacturers are contained in a shipment, the full name and address of each manufacturer performing the country or territory of origin conferring operations must be identified separately.
A detailed description and information is imperative to ensure compliance since the regulations clearly state that the importer must be able to demonstrate their use of reasonable care in determining who the manufacturer is that performs the country or territory of origin conferring operations.
Although CBP has eliminated the Textile Declaration, the new MID procedures call for additional compliance measures by importers. If a MID does not meet the new requirements, CBP can deny entry of the shipment and, possibly, impose penalties for failure to exercise reasonable care. As a consequence, together with their suppliers, importers should have procedures in place to ensure proper identification of the entity that performs the country or territory of origin conferring operations and to communicate that information to UPS Supply Chain Solutions."

Products Made in Iran
Imports from Iran Customs and Border Protection (CBP) prohibits the direct or indirect importation into the U.S. any article that is the product of Islamic Republic of Iran.
U.S. persons and companies that currently import food and carpets from Iran should be aware of the guidance issued July 1, 2010, by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) concerning a change in U.S. law made by the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (""CISADA""). OFAC's Iranian Transactions Regulations currently contain a general license authorizing the importation into the U.S. of foodstuffs from Iran that are classified under chapters 2-23 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) (such as pistachios and non-beluga caviar (which is prohibited by other aspects of law).
In addition, the importation of carpets and other textile floor coverings of Iranian origin that are classified under chapter 57 or heading 9706.00.0060 of the HTS are also authorized.
However, due to the additional Iran sanctions recently passed by Congress, OFAC will soon issue a regulation amending the Iranian Transaction Regulations to eliminate the general license and such imports will be no longer permitted starting on September 29, 2010. OFAC has also indicated that any authorized Iranian products must be imported by September 28, 2010 and it will not issue any specific licenses authorizing any imports after that date. As a result, importers must move quickly to ensure that any pending orders are entered for consumption by their customs brokers by September 28, 2010.

Special Clearance Requirements,"Returned Goods
US Goods are defined in 19 CFR 10.12(e) http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_03/19cfrv1_03.html
There are very specific conditions that must be met in order to use the 9801 tariff numbers. To be eligible to receive duty free treatment the shippers invoice must clearly identify the goods, and must meet the following specifications:
Articles are the growth, product or manufacture of the United States
Products of the United States when returned after having been exported without having been advanced in value or improved in condition by other means while abroad
No drawback has been or will be claimed on such articles
General invoice requirements are available in 19 CFR 141.86 & 142.6 at http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_03/19cfrv2_03.html
An RMA number on the invoice is not sufficient to identify goods as US origin goods.
Articles such as Toshiba Laptops and Hitachi Digital Cameras, while they may have been purchased from a company in the US, would likely not qualify for classification in 9801.00.10xx if they are returned.
Additional invoice information that may be required based on tariff classification in chapter 9801:
Reason goods were exported, e.g. with intent to re-import after temporary use abroad
Reason for return, e.g. for repair, alteration, processing or the like and re-exportation; for credit, not to specifications
Have the goods been advanced in value or improved in condition by other means while abroad
Who goods are being returned to, e.g. original manufacture, original exporter
Were the goods sold for exportation and exported to individuals for personal use
Date goods were originally imported (if applicable) and exported
Repaired Goods
For shipments of repaired goods (this encompasses foreign made goods once imported into the U.S., sent abroad for repair and then returned to the U.S.) the invoice must state:
Country or Territory of Origin
Original cost of the item
Repair cost (the fair market value price of the price of repair)
Duties and taxes will only apply to the repair cost. All other invoice requirements still apply.
